    "description": "Traditionally, security admins comb through logs to identify password spray attack patterns. Now, weâ€™ve enhanced Microsoft Entra ID Protection to detect password spray attacks in real-time. It reduces remediation from hours to seconds by interrupting attacks during the sign-in flow. \n \n Risk-based Conditional Access can automatically respond to this new signal by raising session risk, immediately challenging the next risky sign-in attempt, and stopping password spray attempts in their tracks. This cutting-edge detection, coming soon to public preview, works alongside existing detections for advanced attacks such as Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) phishing and token theft, to ensure comprehensive coverage against modern attacks.",
