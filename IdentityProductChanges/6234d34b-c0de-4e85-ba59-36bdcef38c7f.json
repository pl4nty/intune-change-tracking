    "title": "New Certificate Authorities for login.microsoftonline.com: Action required from customers who only trust DigiCert certificates",
    "description": "Microsoft Entra ID is introducing new Certificate Authorities (CAs) for server certificates for the domain login.microsoftonline.com. At present, connections to login.microsoftonline.com are exclusively presented with DigiCert certificates. Starting on October 1, 2024, you may also encounter certificates issued by Microsoft Azure CAs. This update is designed to enhance security and improve the resilience of Entra ID. This could impact customers who do not trust Microsoft Azure CAs or have pinned client-side to DigiCert certificates, as they may experience authentication failures. \n \n Recommended Action: \n \n To prevent potential issues, we recommend trusting all Root and Subordinate CAs listed in the Azure Certificate public documentation (click Learn more below). This documentation has included Microsoft Azure CAs for over a year. If you are an Entra ID user who utilizes the login.microsoftonline.com domain, it is crucial to remove any client-side pinning to DigiCert and trust the new Azure CAs for a seamless transition.",
