    "title": "Deprecation of Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) hybrid reporting to Microsoft Entra audit log feature",
    "description": "The MIM hybrid reporting feature, introduced with Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) 2016, is being deprecated. This feature allowed the MIM hybrid reporting agent to send event logs from the MIM service to Microsoft Entra, enabling reports for password reset using self-service password reset (SSPR) and self-service group management (SSGM) in the Microsoft Entra audit log. This is replaced by using Azure Arc agent to send those event logs to Azure Monitor as this allows more flexible reports. As of November 2025, the cloud endpoints used by the MIM hybrid reporting agent will no longer be available, and customers should transition to Azure Monitor or similar. Other MIM and Entra ID Connect Health capabilities are unaffected by this deprecation.",
