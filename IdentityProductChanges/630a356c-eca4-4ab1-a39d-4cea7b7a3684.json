    "description": "Starting late August 2024, the \"add sign-in method\" dialog on the My Security-Info page will be updated with improved sign-in method descriptions and a modern look and feel. With this change when users click \"add sign-in method\" they will initially be recommended to register the strongest method available to them which is allowed by organizational authentication method policy. Users will have the ability to click \"show more options\" and choose from all available sign-in methods allowed by their policy. \n This change will occur automatically, and admins won't need to take any action.",
