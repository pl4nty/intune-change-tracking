    "description": "We're excited to announce the public preview of Federated Token Validation Policy. The new validation will block federated tokens (deny sign-in request) from asserting to managed accounts or accounts belonging to a different federated domain in the same tenant. \n With this policy you will be able to secure accounts by validating whether the domain in the mapped Entra ID account matches the token issuer domain. The new policy will confirm that the domain in Entra ID associated with the federated IdP matches with the root domain of the mapped Entra ID account. Admins will be able to apply this policy to all or specific verified federated or managed root domains registered in their Entra ID tenant.",
