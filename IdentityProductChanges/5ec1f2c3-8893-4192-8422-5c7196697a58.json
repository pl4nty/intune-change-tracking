    "description": "Attackers have responded to the rise in multifactor authentication (MFA) adoption by ramping up AitM phishing and social engineering techniques to steal user credentials. Passkeys counter these advanced attacks, as well as password attacks, while simplifying secure sign-ins. \n \n A passkey is a strong, phishing-resistant authentication method you can use to sign in to any internet resource that supports the W3C WebAuthn standard. Passkeys represent the continuing evolution of the FIDO2 standard. \n \n Passkeys in Microsoft Authenticator offer a cost-effective, phishing-resistant credential that users can access directly from their mobile devices, reducing the need to provision and purchase separate security keys. Today, weâ€™re thrilled to share that device-bound passkey support in Microsoft Authenticator for iOS and Android is now Generally Available with improved registration and sign-in experiences, as well as attestation support that verifies the legitimacy of the Microsoft Authenticator app on the user's device before registering the passkey.",
