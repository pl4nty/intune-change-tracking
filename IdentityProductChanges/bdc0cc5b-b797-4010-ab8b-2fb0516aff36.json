    "description": "Starting September 2024, phone call settings (custom greetings and caller ID) under Entra's multifactor authentication blade will be moved under the voice authentication method in the authentication method policy. Instead of accessing these settings through the Entra ID or Azure portal, they will be accessible through MS Graph API.â€¯If your organization is using custom greetings and/or caller ID, please make sure to check the public documentation once we release the new experience to learn how to manage these settings through MS Graph.",
