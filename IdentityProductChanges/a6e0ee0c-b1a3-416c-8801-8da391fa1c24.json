Locations will become the 'Network' assignment, with the new Global Secure Access assignment - 'All compliant network locations'. This change will occur automatically, admins won’t need to take any action. \n \n More details: \n \n - The familiar ‘Locations’ condition is unchanged, updating the policy in the ‘Locations’ condition will be reflected in the ‘Network’ assignment and vice versa. \n - No functionality changes, existing policies will continue to work without changes.",
