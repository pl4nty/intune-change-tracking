    "description": "Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will change the default value of 'signInAudience' property in app registration from ' AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount ' to ' AzureADMyOrg '. Our analysis shows that most new applications do not ever support users outside the application tenant. This will improve latency and security of apps.",
