    "title": "Changes to Dynamic Group Rule Builder",
    "description": "To encourage efficient dynamic group rules, the dynamic group rule builder UX in both Entra and Intune Admin Centers has been updated. As of July 2024, the 'match' and 'notMatch' operators have been removed from the rule builder because they are less efficient and should only be used when absolutely necessary. However, we want to assure you that these operators are still supported by the API and can be written into rules via the text box in both admin centers.",
