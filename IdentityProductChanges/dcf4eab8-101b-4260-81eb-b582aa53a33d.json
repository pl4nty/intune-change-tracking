    "description": "Insider Risk condition in Conditional Access is a new feature that leverages signals from Microsoft Purview's Adaptive Protection capability to enhance the detection and automatic mitigation of Insider threats. This integration allows organizations to more effectively manage and respond to potential insider risks by using advanced analytics and real-time data. \n \n For example, if Purview detects unusual activity from a user, Conditional Access can enforce additional security measures such as requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) or blocking access. This is a premium feature and requires Entra ID P2 license.",
