    "description": "We're excited to introduce a new feature in My Access: a curated list of recommended access packages. This will allow users to quickly view the most relevant access packages without scrolling through a long list. The final tab will be a complete, searchable list of all visible access packages in the tenant. \n \n We will deploy this to all customers as an opt-in preview by the end of October, with in-product messaging to highlight the change. By the end of November, it will transition to an opt-out preview, with general availability (GA) planned for December.",
