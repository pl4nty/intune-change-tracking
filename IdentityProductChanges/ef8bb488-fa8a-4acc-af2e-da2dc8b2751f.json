    "title": "Upgrade to the latest version of Microsoft Entra Connect by April 2, 2025",
    "description": "In early October 2024, we will release a new version of Microsoft Entra Connect Sync that contains a back-end service change that further hardens our services. To avoid service disruptions, customers are required to upgrade to that version (2.4.XX.0) by early April 2025 (exact deadline to be announced upon version release). \n \n Review our roadmap for a timeline of upcoming releases, so that you can plan your upgrade accordingly. We will auto-upgrade customers where supported, alongside an early 2025 release of Connect Sync. For customers who wish to be auto-upgraded, ensure that you have auto-upgrade configured. \n \n For a list of minimum requirements and expected impacts of the service change, please refer to this article. For upgrade-related guidance, check out our docs.",
