    "description": "A CRL is a record of digital certificates that have been revoked before the end of their validity period by a certificate authority (CA). When CAs are uploaded to the Microsoft Entra trust store, a CRL, or more specifically the CrlDistributionPoint attribute, isn't required. A CA can be uploaded without a CRL endpoint, and certificate-based authentication won't fail if an issuing CA doesn't have a CRL specified. \n To strengthen security and avoid misconfigurations, an Authentication Policy Administrator can require CBA authentication to fail if no CRL is configured for a CA that issues an end user certificate.",
