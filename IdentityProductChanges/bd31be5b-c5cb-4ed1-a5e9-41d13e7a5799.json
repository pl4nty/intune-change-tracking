    "description": "As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we are announcing upcoming enhancements to the Entra ID device code flow. These improvements aim to provide a more secure and efficient authentication experience. \n \n \n \n We've refined the messaging and included app details within the device code flow to ensure a more secure and precise user experience. Specifically, we've adjusted headers and calls to action to help your users recognize and respond to security threats more effectively. These changes are designed to help your users make more informed decisions and prevent phishing attacks. \n \n These changes will be gradually introduced starting in July 2024 and are expected to be fully implemented by August 30, 2024. No action required from you.",
