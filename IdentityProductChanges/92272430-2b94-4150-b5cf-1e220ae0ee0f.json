    "description": "Starting June 2024 in the invitation from an organization, the footer will no longer contain an option to block future invitations. A guest user who had unsubscribed before will be subscribed moving forward as we roll out this change. User's will no longer be added to the unsubscribed list which was maintained here in the past: https://invitations.microsoft.com/unsubscribe/manage. \n \n This change will occur automatically—admins and users won’t need to take any action. Here’s more details: \n \n - Email will not have unsubscribe link moving forward. \n - The link in already sent email will not work. \n - Customer who has already unsubscribed would become subscribed.",
