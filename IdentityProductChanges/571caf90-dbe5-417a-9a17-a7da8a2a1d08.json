    "title": "Microsoft Entra new store for certificate-based authentication",
    "description": "Microsoft Entra is has a new scalable PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) based CA (Certificate Authorities) store with higher limits for the number of CAs and the size of each CA file. PKI based CA store allows CAs within each different PKI to be in its own container object allowing administrators to move away from one flat list of CAs to more efficient PKI container based CAs. PKI-based CA store now supports up to 250CAs, 8KB size for each CA and also supports issuers hints attribute for each CA. Administrators can also upload the entire PKI and all the CAs using the \"Upload CBA PKI\" feature or create a PKI container and upload CAs individually. For more information, see How to configure the certificate authorities with PKI-based trust store.",
