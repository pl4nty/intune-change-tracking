Tap the menu icon in Authenticator and select Check for Notifications\" to the Authenticator App sign-in flow. This change involves only the addition of this message, with no admin action required. The rollout will begin automatically in early March 2025. You may want to update any relevant documentation to reflect the refreshed UX as appropriate.",
