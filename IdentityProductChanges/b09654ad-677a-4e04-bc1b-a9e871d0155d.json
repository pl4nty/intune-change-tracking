    "title": "Enabling app instance lock by default",
    "description": "Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will have “App instance lock” enabled by default. The capability called App instance lock for workload identities was launched in September 2023. This feature allows app developers to protect their multi-tenant apps from attackers tampering with critical properties. Applications created using Entra ID portal already have the setting enabled by default, and going forward, it will be enabled for other app creation surface areas such as MS Graph, PowerShell, and SDKs",
