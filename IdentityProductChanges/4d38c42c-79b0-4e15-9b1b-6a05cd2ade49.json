    "description": "When using B2B collaboration and performing a sign-in to a resource tenant, users will notice that they will always see their home tenant branding (whether customized or default branding) instead of continuing to be shown the resource tenant's branding. This will make it clearer for users signing in that they are performing a sign-in against their home tenant and not directly authenticating with the resource tenant.",
