    "title": "Optimized OTP delivery via WhatsApp",
    "description": "Today, Entra ID (Azure AD) MFA supports delivering OTPs via text message (traditional SMS). These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user's phone depending on the phone's operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren't users' primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, we will be running an experiment to deliver OTPs via WhatsApp in the following countries: India, Indonesia and New Zealand. Starting mid-September 2023, some users in the listed countries may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject (but not guaranteed) to receive the updated experience: - Enabled for text messages / SMS as an authentication method - Already use WhatsApp - Have a phone number with a country code in one of the listed countries",
