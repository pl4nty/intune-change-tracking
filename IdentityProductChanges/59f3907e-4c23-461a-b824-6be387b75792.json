    "title": "Retirement of legacy user authentication methods management experience in Entra Portal",
    "description": "Starting October 31 st , 2024 , we will retire the ability to manage user authentication methods in the Entra Portal via the legacy user interface (UI) . Instead, we will only surface the modern UI which has full parity with the legacy experience in addition to the ability to manage modern methods ( e.g. Temporary Access Pass, Passkeys, QR+Pin , etc.) and settings . This will not impact how end users can manage their own authentication methods or their ability to sign-in to Entra.",
