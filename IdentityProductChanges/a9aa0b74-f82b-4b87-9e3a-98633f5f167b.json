    "description": "Intelligent alerts in Microsoft Entra health monitoring notify tenant admins and security engineers whenever a monitored scenario breaks from its typical pattern. Microsoft Entra's alerting capability watches the low-latency health signals of each scenario and fires a notification in the event of an anomaly. The set of alert-ready health signals and scenarios will grow over time. This feature will be available first in MS Graph API, with availability in Microsoft Entra admin center to follow.",
