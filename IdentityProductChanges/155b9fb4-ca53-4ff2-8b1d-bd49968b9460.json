    "title": "Support for PIM enabled Groups in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management",
    "description": "Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Groups in Microsoft Entra ID allows admins to grant users just-in-time membership and ownership of a security group or a Microsoft 365 group. Nested groups are also supported by PIM. For example, if a user is an active member of Group A, and Group A is an eligible member of Group B, the user can activate their membership in Group B. PIM provides a powerful mechanism to manage access and enhance security by granting just-in-time access to critical resources. \n \n Microsoft Entra Permissions Management adds the support to read the just-in-time membership along with existing support for direct group membership. It solves the challenge of having visibility into who has access to what resource with eligible and direct role assignments. The feature enables the complete visibility into RBAC permissions assigned to the identities in different ways and potential impact on Permissions Creep Index (PCI). A complete list of RBAC role assignments which are provisioned directly, via the group membership, or by an eligible group member can be seen per identity under the Analytics tab.",
