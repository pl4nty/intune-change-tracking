Sponsors are responsible to manage and monitor the lifecycle of users and ensure they have access to the right resources driving accountability of guest users for our customers. Setting Sponsors as an attribute is a part of B2B offering. Sponsors as approvers in Entitlement Management is our very first experience in leveraging this attribute where access requests made by guests can be directed to Sponsors for approval. This capability is a part of Microsoft Entra ID Governance SKU . Sponsors are a building block to many such exciting enablementâ€™s that we are working towards.",
