    "description": "Considering our ongoing commitment to security, we are making a minor change to tokens issued for Microsoft Graph after 15 January 2025. In rare cases, this may cause impact to applications if the client application is parsing the access token and expecting a specific format of the aud claim . \n As described in documentation , access tokens should be parsed and validated only by the resource API, and client applications should treat the access token as an opaque string to avoid impact from this or future changes.",
