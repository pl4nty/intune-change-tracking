    "title": "Enhancements to Attribute Collection in Entra External ID",
    "description": "Starting February 2025, weâ€™re excited to announce an important update to the attribute collection page in Entra External ID. When users sign up, they will now see a persistent label next to each input field for both built-in and custom attributes. This enhancement serves two key purposes: \n - Improved Accessibility: The persistent labels will help ensure compliance with accessibility standards, making the sign-up process more user-friendly for all. \n - Enhanced Context: By clearly labeling each attribute collection field with the corresponding user attribute name, users will have better context, especially when values are pre-filled.",
