    "description": "By assigning Microsoft Entra roles to employees, and guests, using Entitlement Management, you can look at a user's entitlements to quickly determine which roles are assigned to that user. When you include a Microsoft Entra role as a resource in an access package, you can also specify whether that role assignment is “eligible” or “active”. \n \n Assigning Microsoft Entra roles through access packages helps to efficiently manage role assignments at scale and improves the role assignment lifecycle.",
