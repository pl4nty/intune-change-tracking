    "title": "Public preview refresh for Hardware OATH tokens",
    "description": "On November 14th, we launched a new version of the Hardware OATH tokens public preview. This update supports end-user self-assignment, activation, and delegated admin access. For more details, refer to the public documentation. \n \n To take advantage of this update, create tokens using the MS Graph API. The new experience will run alongside the legacy version until its deprecation, which will be announced through ‘What's new in Microsoft Entra?’ (aka.ms/entra/whatsnew) and M365 Message Center posts. \n \n To migrate now, remove tokens from the old system and recreate them in the new one using MS Graph. At General Availability, an MS Graph API will be available for per-user token migration without user disruption.",
