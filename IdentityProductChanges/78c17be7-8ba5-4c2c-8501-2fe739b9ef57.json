    "description": "Microsoft Entra organizations could previously have a maximum of 5,000 dynamic groups and dynamic administrative units combined. \n \n We have increased this quota to 15000. For example, you can now have 5,000 dynamic groups and 10,000 dynamic AUs (or any other combination that adds up to 15k). You don't need to do anything to take advantage of this change - it's available right now.",
