    "title": "Deprecating Enable Browser Access (EBA) UI ",
    "description": "EBA is a feature in Android broker apps (such as Company Portal and Authenticator) that enables duplicating the Entra ID device registration certificate to a global keychain location on the Android device. This allows browsers that are not integrated with brokers, such as Chrome, to access the certificate for device authentication, which is required to comply with Entra device compliance policies. \n \n As part of our overall security hardening efforts, we're migrating Entra ID device registration certificates and Android device identities to be hardware-bound. This will enable token protection policies in the future and protect against bypassing device compliance policies. Since the device identity will be hardware-bound, the EBA UI will no longer be able to duplicate and export keys on demand. We plan to deprecate the Enable Browser Access (EBA) UI in the Authenticator and Company Portal apps, and browser access (e.g., Chrome) will automatically be enabled during device registration. \n \n This capability already exists for Intune MDM users. The change extends it to non-Intune users, such as those using VMWare and Jamf mobile device management (MDM) software. This will apply to all customers in the first half of the 2025 calendar year . No action is required from customers at this time .",
