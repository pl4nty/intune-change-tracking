    "description": "As communicated earlier, the capability to manage and change passwords in the My Security Info management portal is now Generally Available. As part of ongoing service improvements, we're replacing the legacy Change Password page with the new, modernized My Security Info experience beginning March 2023. From March to June, through a phased rollout, traffic from the legacy change password experience will redirect users to My Sign Ins. No additional action is required, and this change will occur automatically. The legacy Change Password page will no longer be available after June 2023.",
