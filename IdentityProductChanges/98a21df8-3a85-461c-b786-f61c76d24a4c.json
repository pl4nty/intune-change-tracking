    "description": "Starting in Windows 11, version 22H2 with KB5030310, you can enable a web-based sign-in experience on Microsoft Entra joined devices, unlocking new sign-in options and capabilities. This feature is called Web sign-in. \n \n Web sign-in is a credential provider, and it was initially introduced in Windows 10 with support for Temporary Access Pass (TAP) only. With the release of Windows 11, the supported scenarios and capabilities of Web sign-in are expanded. \n For example, you can sign in with the Microsoft Authenticator app or with a SAML-P federated identity.",
