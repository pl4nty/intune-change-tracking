    "description": "Entitlement Management enables admins to create access packages to manage their organizationâ€™s resources. Admins can either directly assign users to an access package or configure an access package policy that allows users and groups to request access. This option to create self-service processes is useful, especially as organizations scale and hire more employees. However, new employees joining an organization might not always know what they need access to, or how they can request access. In this case, a new employee would likely rely on their manager to guide them through the access request process. \n \n Instead of having new employees navigate the request process, managers can request access packages for their employees, making onboarding faster and more seamless. To enable this functionality for managers, admins can select an option when setting up an access package policy that allows managers to request access on their employees' behalf. \n \n Expanding self-service request flows to allow requests on behalf of employees ensures that users have timely access to necessary resources and increases productivity.",
