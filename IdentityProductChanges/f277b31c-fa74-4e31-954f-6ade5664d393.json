    "title": "Date change announcement: Deprecation of keychain-backed device identity for Apple devices",
    "description": "Earlier this year, we announced the upcoming deprecation of keychain-backed device identity for Apple devices on the Microsoft Entra ID platform. The previously announced deprecation date of June 2026 has been accelerated to June 2025 as part of our commitment to secure design and defaults. This change is being made to enhance device security and better protect your data.   \n Once in effect, this deprecation will ensure that newly registered Apple devices managed by Microsoft Entra ID use strong, hardware-bound cryptographic secrets, backed by Apple’s Secure Enclave. To learn more, we encourage you to review our updated documentation on this deprecation. We advise both consumers and vendors of applications to test their software for compatibility with this new datastore.",
