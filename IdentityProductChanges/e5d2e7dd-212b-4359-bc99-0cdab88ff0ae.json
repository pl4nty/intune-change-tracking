    "description": "The authentication methods migration guide (preview) in the Microsoft Entra Admin center lets you automatically migrate method management from the legacy MFA and SSPR policies to the converged authentication methods policy. Back in 2023, it was announced that the ability to manage authentication methods in the legacy MFA and SSPR policies would be retired in September 2025. Until now, organizations have had to manually migrate methods themselves by leveraging the migration toggle in the converged policy. Now, you can migrate in just a few clicks by leveraging the migration guide. The guide evaluates what your organization currently has enabled in both legacy policies and generates a recommended converged policy configuration for you to review and edit as needed. From there, simply confirm the configuration and we'll set it up for you and mark your migration as complete.",
