    "title": "Enablement of Passkeys in Authenticator for passkey (FIDO2) organizations with no key restrictions",
    "description": "Beginning mid-January 2025, after the General Availability of passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app, organizations with the passkey (FIDO2) authentication methods policy enabled with no key restrictions will be enabled for passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app in addition to FIDO2 security keys. This update aligns with the broader availability of passkeys in Entra ID, extending from device-bound passkeys on security keys to device-bound passkeys also on user devices. Users who navigate to aka.ms/MySecurityInfo will see \"Passkey in Microsoft Authenticator\" as an authentication method they can add. Additionally, when Conditional Access (CA) authentication strengths policy is used to enforce passkey authentication, users who don't yet have any passkey will be prompted inline to register passkeys in Authenticator to meet the CA requirements. If an organization prefers not to enable this change for their users, they can work around it by enabling key restrictions in the passkey (FIDO2) policy. This change will not impact organizations with existing key restrictions or organizations that have not enabled the passkey (FIDO2) policy. \n \n When will this happen? \n \n Rollout will happen mid-January 2025. \n \n How will this affect your organization? \n \n Who will be impacted? \n \n Organizations with the passkey (FIDO2) authentication methods policy enabled with no key restrictions set. \n \n Who will not be impacted? \n \n Organizations that do not have the passkey (FIDO2) authentication methods policy enabled and organizations that have the passkey (FIDO2) authentication methods policy enabled and have key restrictions set. \n \n What you need to do to prepare? \n \n This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.",
