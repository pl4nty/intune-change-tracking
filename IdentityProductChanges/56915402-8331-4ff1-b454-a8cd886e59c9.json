    "title": "Azure MFA Server retirement",
    "description": "Beginning September 30, 2024 , Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server deployments will no longer service multi-factor authentication (MFA) requests, which could cause authentications to fail for your organization. MFA Server will have limited SLA and MFA Activity Report in the Azure Portal will no longer be available. To ensure uninterrupted authentication services and to remain in a supported state, organizations should migrate their usersâ€™ authentication data to the cloud-based Azure MFA service using the latest Migration Utility included in the most recent Azure MFA Server update .",
