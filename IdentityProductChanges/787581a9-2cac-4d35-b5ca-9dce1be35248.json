    "description": "On March 31, 2026 , the Require approved client app control in Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access will be retired and no longer enforced. Before that date, you’ll need to transition and start using the Require app protection policy control. We encourage you to make the switch sooner to gain the richer benefits of the Require app protection policy control, which has all the same capabilities, plus: It verifies the corresponding Intune policy. It’s applied before a user is granted access. It has a strengthened security posture. To avoid any disruptions in service , transition to using the ‘Require app protection policy’ control in Conditional Access by March 31, 2026 .",
