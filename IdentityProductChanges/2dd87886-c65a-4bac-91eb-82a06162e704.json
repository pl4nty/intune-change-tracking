    "title": "Updates to 'Target resources' in Microsoft Entra Conditional Access",
    "description": "Starting in September 2024, the Microsoft Entra Conditional Access 'Target resources' assignment will consolidate the 'Cloud apps' and 'Global Secure Access' options under a new name 'Resources'. \n \n Customers will be able to target 'All internet resources with Global Secure Access', All resources (formerly 'all cloud apps') or select specific resources (formerly 'select apps'). Some of the Global Secure Access attributes in the Conditional Access API will be deprecated. \n \n This change will start in September 2024 and will occur automatically, admins wonâ€™t need to take any action. There are no changes in the behavior of existing Conditional Access policies.",
