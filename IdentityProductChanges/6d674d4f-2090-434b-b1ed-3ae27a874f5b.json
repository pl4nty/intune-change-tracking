    "description": "The Entra ID License utilization portal allows you to see how many Entra ID P1 and P2 licenses you have and the usage of the key features corresponding to the license type. We're thrilled that Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access usage are available as part of the public preview, but this would be expanded to include usage of other SKUs and corresponding features at general availability. This perspective is an initial stride towards empowering you to comprehend your license count and the value you extract from your Entra license. It also aids in addressing any over-usage issues that might emerge in your tenants.",
