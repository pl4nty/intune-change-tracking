    "title": "Private Preview - QR code sign-in, a new authentication method for Frontline Workers",
    "description": "We are introducing a new simple way for Frontline Workers to authenticate in Microsoft Entra ID with a QR code and PIN, eliminating the need to enter long UPNs and alphanumeric passwords multiple times during their shift. \n With the private preview release of this feature in August 2024, all users in your tenant will see a new link ‘Sign in with QR code’ on navigating to https://login.microsoftonline.com > ‘Sign-in options’ > ‘Sign in to an organization’ page. This new link, ‘Sign in with QR code’, will be visible only on mobile devices (Android/iOS/iPadOS). If you are not participating in the private preview, users from your tenant will not be able to sign-in through this method while we are still in private preview. They will receive an error message if they try to sign-in. \n \n \n The feature will have a ‘preview’ tag until it is generally available. Your organization needs to be enabled to test this feature. Broad testing will be available in public preview, which we will announce later. While the feature is in private preview, no technical support will be provided.",
