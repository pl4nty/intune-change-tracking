    "description": "Custom Claims API allows admins to manage and update additional claims for their Enterprise Applications seamlessly through MS Graph. The Custom Claims API offers a simplified and user friendly API experience for claims management for our customers. With the introduction of Custom Claims API, we achieved UX and API interoperability. Admins can now use Entra Portal and MS Graph API interchangeably to manage claims configurations for their Enterprise Applications. It facilitates admins to execute their automations using the API while allowing the flexibility to update claims on the Entra Portal as required on the same policy object.",
