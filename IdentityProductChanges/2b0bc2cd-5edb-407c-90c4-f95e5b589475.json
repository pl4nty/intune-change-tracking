    "description": "Authenticator Lite is a relatively new feature that brings authentication push notifications, similar to Microsoft Authenticator, into 1st party applications – the first of which is Outlook. It's a great alternative for users who can't or aren't willing to download another ‘work’ app on their phone but already have Outlook mobile set up. Currently, this method is only available to organizations who manage Microsoft Authenticator in the converged authentication methods policy. We're now also making it available as a part of the &quot;Notifications through mobile app&quot; method in the per-user MFA policy. Starting mid-September 2023, we'll update the &quot;Notification through mobile app&quot; method such that if it's enabled, then Authenticator Lite is also enabled.",
