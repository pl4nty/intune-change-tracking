    "description": "We are making some improvements to the end user experience when users add their account to a Windows device. We've refined the messaging in the SSO enrollment dialog (consent) to make it easier for end users to understand the choice(s) they can make and the impact of their choice(s). The changes also include a 'Learn more' link on the screen. The link points to a Microsoft Learn article that provides users with more information that will further enable them to make informed choice(s). Please note, the new SSO enrollment dialog will be gradually introduced starting in October 2024.",
