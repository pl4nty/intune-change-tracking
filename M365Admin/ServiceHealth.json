The application uses RMS to protect user data which is synchronized to cloud storage. An application update triggered a reprotection and resync of this data. The resync resulted in a sustained high volume of calls to RMS which exceeded operational thresholds in the Asia Pacific region, resulting in throttling of additional requests. Given the volume and install base of the application, scale up and recovery took several hours.\n\nNext steps: \n- We’re implementing throttling with configurable limits in an efficient manner to not impact quality of service. We expect this repair items to take an extended period to fully implement to ensure these limits do not negatively impact the service. \n\nWe'll provide a preliminary Post-Incident Report within two business days and a final Post-Incident Report within five business days.",

Users outside of the Asia Pacific region could have been affected at a marginal rate if their traffic request was routed through the affected area. \n\nStart time: Wednesday, February 12, 2025, at 11:50 PM UTC\n\nEnd time: Thursday, February 13, 2025, at 5:20 AM UTC\n\nPreliminary root cause: A recent change to a widely-deployed client application caused a denial-of-service condition on the Azure Rights Management Service (RMS), the service that facilitates protection functionality for Information Protection labels, leading to impact to customers. The application uses RMS to protect user data which is synchronized to cloud storage. An application update triggered a reprotection and resync of this data. The resync resulted in a sustained high volume of calls to RMS which exceeded operational thresholds in the Asia Pacific region, resulting in throttling of additional requests. Given the volume and install base of the application, scale up and recovery took several hours.\n\nNext steps: \n- We’re implementing throttling with configurable limits in an efficient manner to not impact quality of service. We expect this repair items to take an extended period to fully implement to ensure these limits do not negatively impact the service. \n\nWe'll provide a preliminary Post-Incident Report within two business days and a final Post-Incident Report within five business days.",
