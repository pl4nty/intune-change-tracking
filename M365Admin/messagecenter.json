A user who needs to modify and collaborate with others on a .pfile can use Microsoft Purview Information protection (MPIP) to remove the label and protection on the .pfile, make changes, and then reapply the label and protection to the updated file.\n</p><p>After this rollout, Microsoft Purview Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (EDLP) will be able to simplify and protect the collaboration experience in managed Windows devices in conjunction with the MPIP client.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Teams will soon have a new location sharing setting that will allow users to grant location access to specific features. This change will affect emergency dynamic policy and the network bandwidth policy.\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop (version 24H2 or greater) and Teams for Mac desktop. VDI clients will not be supported at this time.\n[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early February 2025 and expect to complete by mid-February 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-March (previously late February) and expect to complete by early April 2025 (previously early March).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>Before this rollout: Location access was governed exclusively at the operating system level. With this update, location consent will also be required from users at the individual application level. As a result, users gain more granular control over which specific application features can access their location.\n</p><p>After this rollout, Teams users can grant location access to certain Teams features.

Whether users enable these features manually or through <i>Meeting options</i>, this change ensures the transcription system starts with the correct language configuration.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/f6809bdd-d6ae-4814-8004-5e078842f9de\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><i>Limiting who can change the spoken language for a meeting: </i>When transcription is enabled, either on its own or as part of <i>Recording </i>or <i>Copilot, </i>only the meeting organizer, co-organizer, or the person who started the transcript will be allowed to change the spoken language. This ensures consistency and prevents issues caused by mismatched language settings. If transcription is not enabled, any meeting participant can change the spoken language.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8c95669e-c376-4805-8b0e-374568e62534\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><i>Simplifying language settings:</i> Language settings and caption customization options are on separate screens, instead of overwhelming users with all options in a single screen.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/e1cc25af-c534-452d-ab87-7f14121e411d\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><i>Identifying language mismatches:</i> A <i>Language mismatch detected</i> notification will appear onscreen if the spoken language does not match the settings.

This lets users use their Copilot value on any document to which they have permission. Note that Copilot data protection is always based on the identity used to access the file. This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access. The setting for web grounding in Copilot is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disabled web grounding in Copilot, users will not be able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.

This lets users use their Copilot value on any document to which they have permission. Note that Copilot data protection is always based on the identity used to access the file. This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access. The setting for web grounding in Copilot is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disabled web grounding in Copilot, users will not be able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.  This feature will be available starting in March 2025, at which point, users signed into accounts with external Copilot licenses will be able to use Copilot on their work and school documents in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote desktop and mobile apps.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare] \n</p><p>If you wish to restrict multiple account access to Copilot, you can use the “Multiple account access to Copilot for work documents” <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Policy</a>.&nbsp; This policy setting is expected to be available in Cloud Policy by the end of January 2025</p><p>[Additional information] \n</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2300619\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple account access to Copilot for work and school documents</a>.</p>",

The new usage reports have improved consistency and are more efficient to maintain.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>The retirement will not affect existing default reports in the Search and Intelligence portal. There are some differences between the new and old reports, including changes in metrics (such as the new reports have no query count or average position) and improvements to the user experience. For consistency, you cannot switch back to the old reports, and we will not address the disparities of the old reports at this time.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>You will have access to view old reports until March 31, 2025. We encourage you to download any necessary old reports by this date for your records. Also, we invite you to explore our new search usage reports available in the <i>Insights</i> tab and provide your feedback using the feedback icon in the Search and Intelligence portal.\n</p><p>Learn more about the new search usage reports: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/usage-reports\" target=\"_blank\">Search Usage Reports | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",

Existing policies in the Teams admin center will not be changed; however, tenants that have not customized any part of their Teams meeting policy will be impacted.\n</p><ul><li>Tenants without customized policies: The new default settings will apply, and these tenants will be impacted by this change.\n</li><li>Tenants with customized policies: Policies for user-level assignments or group-level assignments will remain unchanged and unaffected.\n</li></ul><p>This change is designed to streamline the adoption of transcription and enhance the use of all AI features. This change will align transcription with the default policy for recording, which is also enabled by default in Teams admin center. This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop and Teams for Mac desktop.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=468282\" target=\"_blank\">468282</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late February 2025 (previously early February) and expect to complete by late March 2025 (previously mid-February).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>After this rollout, transcription services will be more accessible to users, allowing them to turn on and use transcription as needed during meetings. Transcription will not be automatically activated for every meeting.\n</p><p>For new tenants, transcription will be enabled by default when admins set up their global policies. New tenants will automatically have the transcription policy turned on when they start.

We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online.

This postponement will allow us to address these concerns before making any lasting changes in the behavior of the cmdlet, and to minimize any impact on customers relying on this cmdlet.\n</p><p>To search the audit log programmatically, you could also consider using our new Audit Search Graph API for programmatic access to audit logs.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more about Purview Audit: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-solutions-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about auditing solutions in Microsoft Purview | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>Learn more about the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/search-unifiedauditlog?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Search-UnifiedAuditLog (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p>\n</p>",

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"5300282\" _msthash=\"2426\">In order to automate <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-shared-display-mode-in-meeting-rooms-a59c6886-9028-44da-a3cc-5563be40a214\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">BYOD user experience (BYOD mode)</a> for users in meeting rooms, the peripherals that users plug in must be associated to those rooms in Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro management portal. The Pro management portal will soon use meeting room invite data to intelligently associate peripherals to rooms, automatically creating inventory relationships for you. The association logic relies on many unique users joining a meeting with a specific meeting room booked and the same peripheral plugged in, as identified by serial number and VIDPID. Auto association can also keep up with the times by re-associating a peripheral if it gets physically moved to another room.</p><p _msttexthash=\"2141711\" _msthash=\"2425\">This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=469495\" target=\"_blank\">469495</a>.\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"474019\" _msthash=\"2424\">[When this will happen:]\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"5643534\" _msthash=\"2423\">Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-January 2025 and expect to complete by mid-January 2025.\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"8338876\" _msthash=\"2422\">General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in late January 2025 and expect to complete by late March 2025 (previously early February).\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"1207817\" _msthash=\"2421\">[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"32433973\" _msthash=\"2420\"><b>For you: </b>Shared peripherals (peripherals used by multiple unique users who are in the office) will be automatically associated to your BYOD rooms in the Pro management portal. This automatic process will enable you to see the peripherals in each room.\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"24715847\" _msthash=\"2419\"><b>For your users:</b> After this rollout, users who plug in an associated peripheral will automatically have BYOD mode activated because we can be confident these users are in a meeting room. BYOD mode will have these benefits:\n</p><ul><li _msttexthash=\"16551470\" _msthash=\"2414\">Auto selection of the associated audio/video device in Teams so users never accidentally use their PC’s audio\n</li><li _msttexthash=\"2873429\" _msthash=\"2415\">Shared display mode for enhanced content sharing to the meeting room\n</li><li _msttexthash=\"11066263\" _msthash=\"2416\">Speaker attribution to enable Microsoft Copilot (for Microsoft 365 Copilot license holders) and transcript to recognize speakers in the room\n</li><li _msttexthash=\"5628376\" _msthash=\"2417\">Automatically disable voice isolation to prevent this from filtering out other people in the room\n</li><li _msttexthash=\"1917045\" _msthash=\"2418\">Grouping users under a room node in participant roster\n</li></ul><p _msttexthash=\"25535887\" _msthash=\"2413\"><b>Note: </b>This process relies on bookings and peripheral plug-ins.

A higher threshold may yield a more accurate result but may significantly slow down the process.\n</li><li _msttexthash=\"18842785\" _msthash=\"2409\">Independently mark auto associated rooms or peripherals as verified if you choose to manually check for accuracy, though this may be difficult to scale and is not recommended or necessary.\n</li><li _msttexthash=\"4638335\" _msthash=\"2410\">Enable/disable auto association for specific rooms, or for your entire tenant globally.\n</li><li _msttexthash=\"3758157\" _msthash=\"2411\">Export your inventory associations for use in your own asset management tools.\n</li></ul><p _msttexthash=\"1115283\" _msthash=\"2407\">This change will be available by default. \n</p><p _msttexthash=\"728585\" _msthash=\"2406\">[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><ul><li _msttexthash=\"20121452\" _msthash=\"2404\">Rooms that are hidden in the global address list (GAL) in your tenant are not seen by the Pro management portal. You may wish to make these rooms visible and use another method to make them unbookable.\n</li><li _msttexthash=\"28715505\" _msthash=\"2405\">Some users do not book rooms or plug in peripherals. Both behaviors are necessary for auto association to receive enough signals and confidence to work. You may benefit from encouraging your users to book rooms and plug in peripherals.\n</li></ul><p _msttexthash=\"42424005\" _msthash=\"2403\">This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current room inventory to determine the impact for your organization.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of the convergence of both Microsoft Defender for Identity and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps into Microsoft Defender XDR services, we are continuing to move away from legacy experiences and enhancing the unified experiences.\n</p><p>Therefore, we will gradually retire Defender for Identity's Active Directory and alerts data from Defender for Cloud Apps dedicated experiences. All data, as well as all functionality of the affected experiences, remain available through Microsoft Defender XDR unified experiences, where we will continue to invest our development resources.</p><p>[When this will happen:]&nbsp;</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): This retirement will begin rolling out in late January 2025 and is expected to complete in early May 2025 (previously early March 2025).</p><p> [How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>You are receiving this message because the following changes may affect your organization:\n</p><p>Active directory activities coming from Defender for Identity will no longer be available in Defender for Cloud Apps activity logs. Consequently, Defender for Cloud Apps activity policies will cease from triggering based on Active Directory data.\n</p><p>All Active Directory activities data remains available through Advanced Hunting, in the following tables:\n</p><ul><li>IdentityLogonEvents\n</li><li>IdentityDirectoryEvents\n</li><li>IdentityQueryEvents \n</li></ul><p>To learn more about Advanced Hunting and the Data Schema, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Proactively hunt for threats with advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-schema-tables\" target=\"_blank\">Understand the advanced hunting schema</a>.</p><p>New Active Directory activities, as well as Defender for Identity's alerts data, will no longer be available through Defender for Cloud Apps Activities API, Alerts API, or dedicated SIEM agents.\n</p><p>All activities and alerts data remains available through Defender XDR Streaming API and Event Hubs.\n</p><p>Learn more about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-xdr/streaming-api\" target=\"_blank\">Streaming API</a>.</p><p>For more information about how to integrate your SIEM tools with Microsoft Defender XDR, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-xdr/configure-siem-defender#ingesting-streaming-event-data-via-event-hubs\" target=\"_blank\">Ingesting streaming event data via Event Hubs</a>.</p><p>The Identities page under 'Assets' in the XDR portal will be updated to better support the new experiences.

        "Title": "(Updated) Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat available in Teams and Outlook",
        "Description": "<p>Updated February 12, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In mid-January, Microsoft Copilot will become available to users with an Entra account in Microsoft Teams and Outlook. If pinned, Entra users will be able to access the Microsoft Copilot app directly from the left rail in Outlook and Teams. On Teams Mobile, the pinned app will show up in the top header. Microsoft Copilot will also become available in the Store for users to add on their own, managed by the same admin settings used for app availability today. Outlook Mobile will have Copilot show up in the tab bar starting in February.</p><p>Note: During the rollout, the Microsoft Copilot app will temporarily be available for Semi-Annual Channel users of classic Outlook for Windows. These clients will respect admin and user preferences, but we typically do not show Copilot features in Semi-Annual Channel of classic Outlook for Windows. After customers update to Version 2408 or newer, the Microsoft Copilot app will once again be hidden for Semi-Annual Channel users.</p><p>In addition, users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will have Copilot automatically pinned in the left rail in Teams, along with the Copilot chat that is automatically pinned in the Teams Chat pane for them today.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=420330\" target=\"_blank\">420330</a>\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The Microsoft 365 Copilot app will be pinned by default in the Teams left rail staring late January 2025 (previously mid-January)  and is expected to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January).</p><p> </p><ul><li>On Teams Mobile, the pinned app will show up in the top header.&nbsp;</li><li>Outlook Mobile will have Copilot show up in the tab bar starting in mid-February 2025.</li></ul><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The Microsoft Copilot app will be available to install and pin in Outlook starting mid-February 2025 (previously late January) and is expected to complete by mid-March 2025 (previously late February). The Microsoft Copilot app has now shipped 100% worldwide to Teams and is available to install and pin.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>Starting mid-January, Microsoft Copilot admins and users will be able to pin the Copilot app in Teams and Outlook. Copilot will not be pinned by default for users without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.  If pinned, users will be able to access the Microsoft Copilot app in Teams and Outlook.\n</p><p>If your admins or users previously chose to pin Microsoft Copilot across the M365 app, Teams, and Outlook before pinning was released on Teams and Outlook, Microsoft Copilot will be retroactively pinned for them there.</p><p>Microsoft Copilot will also be added to the Store for users to add on their own. For licensed users, Microsoft 365 Copilot has already been installed, and users can open it from the Store.</p><p>Finally, in Teams, users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will be able to access Copilot in the left rail as a pinned app by default, along with the Teams Chat pane where they can find it today. On Teams Mobile, users can access Copilot in the top header, and on Outlook Mobile in the tab bar.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>Admins can control if Microsoft Copilot is pinned in Teams and Outlook using the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/microsoft-365/pin-copilot\" target=\"_blank\">same Copilot pinning control shared previously to pin Copilot in the Microsoft 365 app.</a> Admins can also pin Microsoft Copilot in Teams by adding Copilot to Pinned apps in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies\" target=\"_blank\">app Setup policies</a> and assigning the policies to unlicensed users in Teams admin center.\n</p><p>With the pinning control, you have the option to pin or not pin Copilot for your users. If you select to not pin Copilot, you also have the option to allow your users to be notified to make this choice. If no action is taken, Copilot will not be pinned but users will be notified to pin it themselves.\n</p><p>Users can unpin Copilot in Outlook. Users can unpin Copilot in Teams if User pinning is enabled in app <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#pin-apps\" target=\"_blank\">Setup policies.</a>\n</p><p>Currently, you can remove access to Copilot in the Microsoft 365 app and copilot.cloud.microsoft as documented in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/manage#removing-access-to-microsoft-\" target=\"_blank\">Removing access to Microsoft Copilot</a>.

Because migrations can take time, we recommend starting to upgrade any remaining devices your organization has running Office 2016 or Office 2019 to a supported version as soon as possible.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>To mitigate these risks and ensure your organization remains secure and compliant, we recommend upgrading devices running Office 2016 or Office 2019 to <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/e3\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 E3</a>, which includes Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise plus core device management, security, and compliance capabilities. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise provides the latest versions of desktop apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint with regular updates and continuous support under the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/faq/modern-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle </a>Policy and is eligible for the Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on.\n</p><p>For scenarios that require a fully disconnected solution, we recommend upgrading to <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/office-ltsc-2024-is-now-available/ba-p/4244953\" target=\"_blank\">Office LTSC 2024</a>. Office LTSC 2024 includes a subset of the value in Microsoft 365 Apps and will be supported for five years under the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/faq/fixed-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Fixed Lifecycle Policy</a>.\n</p><p>Resources to help you prepare for this transition:\n</p><ul><li> Read the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/endofsupport/plan-upgrade-older-versions-office\" target=\"_blank\">upgrade guidance</a> for an overview of how to move from Office 2016 or Office 2019 to Microsoft 365 Apps.\n</li><li>Consider engaging <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft FastTrack</a>, a Microsoft support service for moving to Microsoft 365 E3.\n</li><li>Visit our <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-office-end-of-support/ct-p/OfficeEOS\" target=\"_blank\">Office End of Support Tech Community</a> for more information and resources about the end of support for Office. \n</li></ul><p>Planning ahead will help you avoid potential disruptions and keep your organization’s software environment secure and up to date.</p>",

This rollout allows users to easily discover and use apps that they have previously used in group chats, channels, and meetings, enabling users to consent to use the app everywhere in Teams with one click. This message applies to Teams on Windows and Mac desktops and to Teams on the web. \n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=397089\" target=\"_blank\">397089</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by mid-February 2025 (previously late January).\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>In Teams, when one user installs an app to a group chat, channel, or meeting, others in the group can use it without installing the app. Before this rollout, it is not easy for others in the group to rediscover these apps for use everywhere in Teams.\n</p><p>After this rollout, users can more easily find and use apps they previously used in Teams, because these apps will appear at the top of the list of apps in Teams menus:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/de9e5f70-3f42-48b4-8e55-4cc46142caa0\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>After this rollout, users will be able to find apps they used in a group experience, but did not install themselves. If users click such an app, a consent screen appears.

No additional admin configuration is needed for this feature\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>.

This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>In 2023, we introduced Microsoft Teams apps that are compatible with Microsoft Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App (manifest version v1.13 or higher). Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in two major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late-January 2025 (previously mid-December 2024) and expect to complete late March 2025 (previously mid-January 2025). This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in March 2025. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. [For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)].</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. [For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)].</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",

This phase applies to tenants who meet both conditions: 1) tenants with apps added to <i>Installed apps</i> in the Global app setup policy and 2) tenants with no custom app setup policies created in the Teams admin center. This phase will migrate apps installed in the Global app setup policy to app centric management.\n</li><li>Phase 3 | More details coming soon as a follow up MC post. This phase applies to tenants with both the Global app setup policy and custom app setup policies. This phase will migrate apps installed for users and groups through <i>Installed apps</i> in app setup policies to app centric management.\n</li><li>Phase 4 | More details coming soon as a follow up MC post. This phase applies to all remaining tenants.\n</li></ul><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Before the rollout: If you install an app to a user, the user cannot actually use an admin preinstalled app if you did not take the additional step to allow the user to use it. After the rollout, if you install an app through app centric management, the user will immediately be able to use the app.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Before the roll out, a user will only have apps installed from a single app setup policy, following the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/assign-policies-users-and-groups#precedence-rules\" target=\"_blank\">policy resolution precedence rules</a>. After the rollout, if you have multiple custom app setup policies assigned to users or groups, apps from every policy will be installed to&nbsp;the user or group assigned to&nbsp;that policy, regardless of the policy resolution precedence rules.\n</p><p>&nbsp;[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>No action needed for Phase 1 tenants. We will update this message with more information before the rollouts for Phases 2-4 tenants.\n</p><p>You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",

Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>We are beginning the process to standardize all transcript storage to OneDrive, starting with the storage of transcripts for meetings that only have transcription enabled. Previously, meetings with only transcription enabled saved the transcript file to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online, while meetings with both recording and transcription enabled saved two transcript copies—one that is coupled with the recording saved to OneDrive and another transcript copy saved to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p><p>Now with this feature, meetings that have only transcription enabled will also save two copies (one in OneDrive and one in Exchange Online), but all meeting transcript entry points in Teams app will point to the OneDrive copy only, no entry points for meeting transcripts will source from the Exchange Online copy. <i>At the same time</i>, meeting transcripts will stop saving in Exchange Online altogether and all transcript storage will be standardized on OneDrive only.&nbsp;</p><p>The rollout of this feature also improves both the experience of meeting organizers to manually delete the transcript, as well as the ability for IT administrators to apply retention policies to the transcripts from meetings that only had transcription enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>A summary of the deletion experience for meeting transcripts is captured in the following table:&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th>User</th>\n    <th>Type of transcript deletion</th>\n    <th>Previous experience</th>\n<th>New Experience with this feature rollout</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer </th>\n    <td>Manually from Teams app</td>\n    <td>Only deleted Exchange Online transcript file</td>\n<td>Deletes both copies of the transcript file from OneDrive and Exchange Online</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer</th>\n    <td>Manually from Stream</td>\n    <td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n<td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>IT Administrator</th>\n    <td>Retention policies in Teams Admin Center</td>\n    <td>Only available for copies saved in OneDrive, so only applicable to meetings with recording turned on.</td>\n<td><p>Now the retention policy is also applicable to meetings with only transcription enabled and to the transcript file saved in OneDrive.</p><p> \n \nTo bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> \n\n</p></td>\n  </tr>\n\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=365720\" target=\"_blank\">365720</a></p>\n<p>[When this will happen:] \n</p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out early June 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2024 (previously late May). \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 (previously late May) and expect to complete by late August 2024 (previously mid-August).\n</p><p>GCC High: We will begin rolling out late August 2024 and expect to complete by mid-September 2024.\n</p><p>DoD: We will begin rolling out late September 2024 and expect to complete by late March 2025 (previously late January).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:] \n</p><p>There is no change to the end user experience for viewing and downloading Teams meeting transcripts. The only change for meeting organizers and co-organizers is for any meetings that are held after this feature rolls out, they can delete all copies of the meeting transcript directly from the Teams app, instead of having to manually delete all copies of the transcript from two places (Teams app and Stream). For IT administrators, they can start applying retention policies for the copy of the transcript saved in OneDrive, including scenarios where a meeting only had transcription enabled.

        "Description": "<p>Updated February 21, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>We are beginning the process to standardize all transcript storage to OneDrive, starting with the storage of transcripts for meetings that only have transcription enabled. Previously, meetings with only transcription enabled saved the transcript file to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online, while meetings with both recording and transcription enabled saved two transcript copies—one that is coupled with the recording saved to OneDrive and another transcript copy saved to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p><p>Now with this feature, meetings that have only transcription enabled will also save two copies (one in OneDrive and one in Exchange Online), but all meeting transcript entry points in Teams app will point to the OneDrive copy only, no entry points for meeting transcripts will source from the Exchange Online copy. <i>At the same time</i>, meeting transcripts will stop saving in Exchange Online altogether and all transcript storage will be standardized on OneDrive only.&nbsp;</p><p>The rollout of this feature also improves both the experience of meeting organizers to manually delete the transcript, as well as the ability for IT administrators to apply retention policies to the transcripts from meetings that only had transcription enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>A summary of the deletion experience for meeting transcripts is captured in the following table:&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th>User</th>\n    <th>Type of transcript deletion</th>\n    <th>Previous experience</th>\n<th>New Experience with this feature rollout</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer </th>\n    <td>Manually from Teams app</td>\n    <td>Only deleted Exchange Online transcript file</td>\n<td>Deletes both copies of the transcript file from OneDrive and Exchange Online</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer</th>\n    <td>Manually from Stream</td>\n    <td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n<td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>IT Administrator</th>\n    <td>Retention policies in Teams Admin Center</td>\n    <td>Only available for copies saved in OneDrive, so only applicable to meetings with recording turned on.</td>\n<td><p>Now the retention policy is also applicable to meetings with only transcription enabled and to the transcript file saved in OneDrive.</p><p> \n \nTo bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> \n\n</p></td>\n  </tr>\n\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=365720\" target=\"_blank\">365720</a></p>\n<p>[When this will happen:] \n</p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out early June 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2024 (previously late May). \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 (previously late May) and expect to complete by late August 2024 (previously mid-August).\n</p><p>GCC High: We will begin rolling out late August 2024 and expect to complete by mid-September 2024.\n</p><p>DoD: We will begin rolling out late September 2024 and expect to complete by late March 2025 (previously late January).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:] \n</p><p>There is no change to the end user experience for viewing and downloading Teams meeting transcripts. The only change for meeting organizers and co-organizers is for any meetings that are held after this feature rolls out, they can delete all copies of the meeting transcript directly from the Teams app, instead of having to manually delete all copies of the transcript from two places (Teams app and Stream). For IT administrators, they can start applying retention policies for the copy of the transcript saved in OneDrive, including scenarios where a meeting only had transcription enabled.

        "DisplayDescription": "<p>Updated February 13, 2025: Migration has now started.\n</p><p>As outlined in MC677236 (July 2024), Azure to OneDrive migration of existing Whiteboards has now started and will reach your tenant (if you haven’t received it already) in the coming months, before June 2025. Complete details can be found in this support article: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/migration-of-whiteboards-from-azure-to-onedrive-6ddc6df1-540e-4b70-8e6a-541fafdc24f4\" target=\"_blank\">Migration of Whiteboards from Azure to OneDrive - Microsoft Support</a>.\n</p><p><i>Action for admins</i>: The migration affects only Microsoft Azure-based Whiteboards. If your tenant does not have any Azure Whiteboards, this migration does not impact you. Check if your tenant has Azure Whiteboards using this PowerShell cmdlet: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/whiteboard/get-whiteboardsfortenant?view=whiteboard-ps\" target=\"_blank\">- Get-WhiteboardsForTenant</a>\n</p><p><i>Action item for users:</i> Until the migration completes. When your tenant receives the migration code, users can trigger a migration by starting a Whiteboard session from a web browser by simply going to <a href=\"https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/</a> or by using a Whiteboard in their Teams meetings.</p><p>Whiteboard previously stored whiteboard files in Azure storage. In 2022, Whiteboard switched to OneDrive as the storage location for most newly created boards. We made a client-based migration available for your organization, which is currently rolling out gradually.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=117394%2C\" target=\"_blank\">117394</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen]\n</p><p>The client-based migration experience started in December 2024 (previously July), and we expect to complete the migration by early June 2025.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization]\n</p><p>Any user who launches an eligible Whiteboard client (Whiteboard on Windows, Whiteboard in Teams desktop/web) will automatically kick off a non-blocking migration of all their whiteboards. Depending on how many whiteboards they have, on average the process will take between a few seconds to a few minutes.\n</p><p>The migration will provide many benefits for your organization and users on the migrated boards, including:\n</p><ul><li>Features unique to whiteboards stored in OneDrive, such as Follow, Commenting, and more.\n</li><li>Improved performance on whiteboards now stored in OneDrive.\n</li><li>Improved compliance and security associated with whiteboard being stored in OneDrive.\n</li></ul><p>There is no possibility to delay the migration.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare]\n</p><p>The migration will happen naturally and automatically for most users in your organization with no disruption, but please ensure that users are aware they need to launch Whiteboard in one of the previously mentioned clients in order to keep their content prior to the conclusion of the migration.\n</p><p>In the unlikely case that a user’s whiteboards fail to migrate, they will see an error banner.

        "Description": "<p>Updated February 13, 2025: Migration has now started.\n</p><p>As outlined in MC677236 (July 2024), Azure to OneDrive migration of existing Whiteboards has now started and will reach your tenant (if you haven’t received it already) in the coming months, before June 2025. Complete details can be found in this support article: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/migration-of-whiteboards-from-azure-to-onedrive-6ddc6df1-540e-4b70-8e6a-541fafdc24f4\" target=\"_blank\">Migration of Whiteboards from Azure to OneDrive - Microsoft Support</a>.\n</p><p><i>Action for admins</i>: The migration affects only Microsoft Azure-based Whiteboards. If your tenant does not have any Azure Whiteboards, this migration does not impact you. Check if your tenant has Azure Whiteboards using this PowerShell cmdlet: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/whiteboard/get-whiteboardsfortenant?view=whiteboard-ps\" target=\"_blank\">- Get-WhiteboardsForTenant</a>\n</p><p><i>Action item for users:</i> Until the migration completes. When your tenant receives the migration code, users can trigger a migration by starting a Whiteboard session from a web browser by simply going to <a href=\"https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/</a> or by using a Whiteboard in their Teams meetings.</p><p>Whiteboard previously stored whiteboard files in Azure storage. In 2022, Whiteboard switched to OneDrive as the storage location for most newly created boards. We made a client-based migration available for your organization, which is currently rolling out gradually.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=117394%2C\" target=\"_blank\">117394</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen]\n</p><p>The client-based migration experience started in December 2024 (previously July), and we expect to complete the migration by early June 2025.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization]\n</p><p>Any user who launches an eligible Whiteboard client (Whiteboard on Windows, Whiteboard in Teams desktop/web) will automatically kick off a non-blocking migration of all their whiteboards. Depending on how many whiteboards they have, on average the process will take between a few seconds to a few minutes.\n</p><p>The migration will provide many benefits for your organization and users on the migrated boards, including:\n</p><ul><li>Features unique to whiteboards stored in OneDrive, such as Follow, Commenting, and more.\n</li><li>Improved performance on whiteboards now stored in OneDrive.\n</li><li>Improved compliance and security associated with whiteboard being stored in OneDrive.\n</li></ul><p>There is no possibility to delay the migration.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare]\n</p><p>The migration will happen naturally and automatically for most users in your organization with no disruption, but please ensure that users are aware they need to launch Whiteboard in one of the previously mentioned clients in order to keep their content prior to the conclusion of the migration.\n</p><p>In the unlikely case that a user’s whiteboards fail to migrate, they will see an error banner. We will attempt to migrate the board again in 30 days. If the board contains important information, we recommend the user copy the content to a new whiteboard.\n</p><p>Users will be able to see which boards have not migrated in a dedicated section on the board picker. Admins will be able to verify what whiteboard content remains in Azure and obtain the userIDs via our PowerShell cmdlets, if you wish to proactively notify users to get their content.\n</p><p>Complete details about the migration can be found in <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/migration-of-whiteboards-from-azure-to-onedrive-6ddc6df1-540e-4b70-8e6a-541fafdc24f4\" target=\"_blank\">Migration of Whiteboards from Azure to OneDrive - Microsoft Support</a>, including how start and completion of migration will be notified, how errors will be communicated, and the new PowerShell cmdlets.</p>",

This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort.

Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through early March 2025 (previously January 1). You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",

In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through early March 2025 (previously January 1). You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",
