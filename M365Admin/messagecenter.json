The new article <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2305054\" target=\"_blank\">Map classic Outlook policies to new Outlook</a> explains how key policies you may be using to control classic Outlook will map to new Outlook. We encourage admins to read the article and make the necessary policy updates in new Outlook for Windows to achieve their desired behavior.\n</p><p>Administrators should make sure to review the policies available to control whether mailboxes outside of your Microsoft 365 tenant can be connected to new Outlook for Windows. If you want to restrict the kinds of email accounts that can be connected to new Outlook, you should ensure you have configured these policies:\n</p><p>1. Set the policy to require that new Outlook must use a managed device's Windows signed-in account as the primary account. Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/outlook/manage/policy-management#automatically-configure-account-based-on-active-directory-primary-smtp-address\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/outlook/manage/policy-management#automatically-configure-account-based-on-active-directory-primary-smtp-address\" target=\"_blank\">Automatically configure account based on Active Directory Primary SMTP address</a>\n</li><li>MC800501 (Updated) <i>New Microsoft Outlook for Windows: Automatically configure accounts with new policy</i> (published June 2024, updated August 2024)\n</li></ul><p style=\"margin-left: 25px;\"><b>Note:</b> Setting the policy in #1 is required to ensure that new Outlook connects to the work or school account configured with the organization’s set of policies. If you do not set this policy, a user who has not already signed into new Outlook with their work or school account will be able to connect using a personal mailbox (such as Outlook.com, Gmail, IMAP) before signing in with their work or school account. \n</p><p>2.  Set the <code>PersonalAccountsEnabled</code> policy on your organization's mailbox to control whether personal mailboxes can also be connected to new Outlook. Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/outlook/manage/policy-management#allow-only-corporate-mailboxes-to-be-added\" target=\"_blank\">Allow only corporate mailboxes to be added</a>\n</p><p>3. Set the <code>AllowedOrganizationAccountDomains</code> policy on your organization's mailbox to control whether work or school mailboxes on a different SMTP domain can also be connected to new Outlook. Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/outlook/manage/policy-management#allow-only-corporate-mailboxes-to-be-added\" target=\"_blank\">Allow only corporate mailboxes to be added</a>\n</p><p><b>Note:</b> To prevent your organization's mailboxes from connecting to new Outlook, along with any other mailbox, you must still set the policy in #1. Also, set the <code>OneWinNativeOutlookEnabled</code> policy to <code>false</code>. These two actions will prevent your organization's mailboxes from signing into new Outlook and will also prevent users from selecting any other mailboxes to sign in.

This setting allows all internal users in an organization to access certain content while excluding external users. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/access-management/grant-everyone-claim-to-external-users#use-microsoft-entra-groups-and-dynamic-membership-instead-of-default-claims\" target=\"_blank\">We discourage use of this setting</a> due to concerns about inadvertent oversharing of user data.\n</p><p>[What is changing]\n</p><p>Starting April 10, 2025 and ending by September 30, 2025, we will run logic to detect and remove the EEEU permission from the root site of each user’s OneDrive and the default document library in OneDrive.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Before this retirement, apps, processes, or users may be able to discover and access content from OneDrive because of the inadvertent presence of EEEU in the root web and default document library in OneDrive. After the EEEU permission is removed, these apps, processes, and users will lose access to the content from the affected OneDrive accounts. Users, processes, and apps that were granted direct permissions to specific files and folders of a OneDrive account will not be impacted and will continue to retain their access.\n</p><p>We recommend OneDrive owners and OneDrive admins give explicit permission to individual files and folders in OneDrive to be accessed by one or more users or apps.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>This change will happen automatically by the specified date.

This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed. The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity.\n</p><p>When the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.\n</p><p>This setting update is not needed for newer Bluetooth headsets as the battery life is already optimal.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/65b030c3-88d0-4c81-9b7f-5362f43d716b\" style=\"width: 800px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>This change will be available by default.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>Learn more: The section called <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/walkie-talkie#get-insight-into-walkie-talkie-usage-and-performance\" target=\"_blank\">Get insight into Walkie Talkie usage and performance</a> in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/walkie-talkie\" target=\"_blank\">Manage the Walkie Talkie app in Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

        "Description": "<p><b>NOTE:</b> If your organization does not support Android devices, you can safely ignore this message.\nComing soon for the Walkie Talkie app in Microsoft Teams: New user <i>Connection Settings</i> for <i>Headset microphones</i> that are designed to optimize battery life for older Bluetooth headsets.\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams on Android only.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=476733\" target=\"_blank\">476733</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early March 2025 and expect to complete by late March 2025.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the new <i>Connection Settings</i> for Headset microphones use SCO (Synchronous Connection-Oriented) to control whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed. The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity.\n</p><p>When the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.\n</p><p>This setting update is not needed for newer Bluetooth headsets as the battery life is already optimal.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/65b030c3-88d0-4c81-9b7f-5362f43d716b\" style=\"width: 800px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>This change will be available by default.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>Learn more: The section called <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/walkie-talkie#get-insight-into-walkie-talkie-usage-and-performance\" target=\"_blank\">Get insight into Walkie Talkie usage and performance</a> in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/walkie-talkie\" target=\"_blank\">Manage the Walkie Talkie app in Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

        "Description": "<p>Before this rollout, users can apply a sensitivity label to a non-Office file or a PDF file in Microsoft Windows to apply protection that encapsulates the file into a .pfile file type that can verify user authorization and rights on the file.  A user who needs to modify and collaborate with others on a .pfile can use Microsoft Purview Information protection (MPIP) to remove the label and protection on the .pfile, make changes, and then reapply the label and protection to the updated file.\n</p><p>After this rollout, Microsoft Purview Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (EDLP) will be able to simplify and protect the collaboration experience in managed Windows devices in conjunction with the MPIP client. Non-Office files and PDF files stored on managed devices will be labeled while retaining their original file types to allow a user to modify and update the file on their device. When a user copies and uploads a labeled file to a destination external to their Windows device, EDLP will help enforce the rights protection by converting the file to a .pfile for secure sharing to other users.

        "DisplayDescription": "<p>Updated February 21, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Teams will soon have a new location sharing setting that will allow users to grant location access to specific features. This change will affect emergency dynamic policy and the network bandwidth policy.\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop (version 24H2 or greater) and Teams for Mac desktop. VDI clients will not be supported at this time.\n[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early February 2025 and expect to complete by mid-February 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-March (previously late February) and expect to complete by early April 2025 (previously early March).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>Before this rollout: Location access was governed exclusively at the operating system level. With this update, location consent will also be required from users at the individual application level. As a result, users gain more granular control over which specific application features can access their location.\n</p><p>After this rollout, Teams users can grant location access to certain Teams features. The setting for <i>IT insights for admins</i> feature are in Teams <i>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location</i>. The setting for the <i>Emergency calls</i> feature is in the user's device's location settings. The user can find a link to their device's location settings in Teams <i>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location:</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8a2b2583-193d-4576-8c8f-0cca51e97e36\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>If a user consented to location access before the rollout, the user will be prompted to confirm their selection in this new popup that will display after the next Teams version update. If a user has not previously consented, they will not see the popup and can adjust their preferences in <i>Settings.</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/17e58a37-125e-4761-98c4-2aa35808ca09\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> After this rollout, dynamic emergency calling may not work as intended unless users allow location detection at the operating system level and app level. This dynamic emergency calling issue includes scenarios where admins have configured a network site for their users (location must be enabled by the user).

        "Description": "<p>Updated February 21, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Teams will soon have a new location sharing setting that will allow users to grant location access to specific features. This change will affect emergency dynamic policy and the network bandwidth policy.\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop (version 24H2 or greater) and Teams for Mac desktop. VDI clients will not be supported at this time.\n[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early February 2025 and expect to complete by mid-February 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-March (previously late February) and expect to complete by early April 2025 (previously early March).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>Before this rollout: Location access was governed exclusively at the operating system level. With this update, location consent will also be required from users at the individual application level. As a result, users gain more granular control over which specific application features can access their location.\n</p><p>After this rollout, Teams users can grant location access to certain Teams features. The setting for <i>IT insights for admins</i> feature are in Teams <i>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location</i>. The setting for the <i>Emergency calls</i> feature is in the user's device's location settings. The user can find a link to their device's location settings in Teams <i>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location:</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8a2b2583-193d-4576-8c8f-0cca51e97e36\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>If a user consented to location access before the rollout, the user will be prompted to confirm their selection in this new popup that will display after the next Teams version update.

This feature will help admins and analysts view this information in IRM without switching to DLP.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=475057\" target=\"_blank\">475057</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out early March 2025 and expect to complete by late March 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late May 2025 and expect to complete by mid-June 2025.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Admins will be able to enable this indicator in IRM’s global settings for policy indicators.

These improvements will also enhance the quality of live captions in Teams, Microsoft Copilot in Teams, and intelligent meeting recap for Microsoft Teams Premium users and users with a Copilot license, ensuring more accurate outputs and enhancing the overall experience of each feature.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=471426\" target=\"_blank\">471426</a>.\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop and Teams for Mac desktop.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 and expect to complete by late February 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out late February 2025 and expect to complete by early March 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-March 2025 and expect to complete by late March 2025.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Key changes in this rollout:\n</p><p><i>Setting the meeting spoken language up front: </i>Before starting features like <i>Recording, Transcription, </i>or <i>Copilot</i> that generate transcripts, users will be prompted to set the spoken language. Whether users enable these features manually or through <i>Meeting options</i>, this change ensures the transcription system starts with the correct language configuration.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/f6809bdd-d6ae-4814-8004-5e078842f9de\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><i>Limiting who can change the spoken language for a meeting: </i>When transcription is enabled, either on its own or as part of <i>Recording </i>or <i>Copilot, </i>only the meeting organizer, co-organizer, or the person who started the transcript will be allowed to change the spoken language. This ensures consistency and prevents issues caused by mismatched language settings. If transcription is not enabled, any meeting participant can change the spoken language.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8c95669e-c376-4805-8b0e-374568e62534\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><i>Simplifying language settings:</i> Language settings and caption customization options are on separate screens, instead of overwhelming users with all options in a single screen.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/e1cc25af-c534-452d-ab87-7f14121e411d\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><i>Identifying language mismatches:</i> A <i>Language mismatch detected</i> notification will appear onscreen if the spoken language does not match the settings. Users can quickly resolve mismatches by confirming the system’s language suggestion directly from the notification, avoiding the need to navigate through settings.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/7a6db575-4031-49c2-adcd-86fe370bdd16\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>This change will be available to users by default.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before or after the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",

This lets users use their Copilot value on any document to which they have permission. Note that Copilot data protection is always based on the identity used to access the file. This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access. The setting for web grounding in Copilot is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disabled web grounding in Copilot, users will not be able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.  This feature will be available starting in March 2025, at which point, users signed into accounts with external Copilot licenses will be able to use Copilot on their work and school documents in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote desktop and mobile apps.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare] \n</p><p>If you wish to restrict multiple account access to Copilot, you can use the “Multiple account access to Copilot for work documents” <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Policy</a>.&nbsp; This policy setting is expected to be available in Cloud Policy by the end of January 2025</p><p>[Additional information] \n</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2300619\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple account access to Copilot for work and school documents</a>.</p>",

But we’re working on making the localized versions available as soon as we can.</p><p>Multiple account access to Copilot in Microsoft 365 desktop and mobile apps will be available soon.</p><p>[When will this happen] \n</p><p>General availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in early March 2025 and expect to complete by late March 2025.</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Policy</a> to manage use will be available by late January 2025.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization] \n</p><p>As an M365 service, Copilot can be used across signed in accounts in clients that allow you to sign in with multiple accounts. This lets users use their Copilot value on any document to which they have permission. Note that Copilot data protection is always based on the identity used to access the file. This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access. The setting for web grounding in Copilot is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disabled web grounding in Copilot, users will not be able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.  This feature will be available starting in March 2025, at which point, users signed into accounts with external Copilot licenses will be able to use Copilot on their work and school documents in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote desktop and mobile apps.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare] \n</p><p>If you wish to restrict multiple account access to Copilot, you can use the “Multiple account access to Copilot for work documents” <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Policy</a>.&nbsp; This policy setting is expected to be available in Cloud Policy by the end of January 2025</p><p>[Additional information] \n</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2300619\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple account access to Copilot for work and school documents</a>.</p>",

Consequently, there will not be a dedicated page of work or school results and users’ work or school profiles will no longer appear on Bing.com. However, selecting the Work or School tab on Bing.com will redirect users to the new Microsoft Search experience on M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com).\n</li><li>Search boxes you’ve configured to point to Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer provide work or school results.\n</li><li>The Edge for Business address bar and Windows search box will continue to support work and school search with some adjustments, including:\n<ul><li>The Edge for Business address bar will no longer return work or school search results on a Bing.com page but will continue to provide suggested results in the address bar. In addition, the address bar will send users to work and school results on M365.cloud.microsoft rather than Bing.com. Users of the address bar can continue to find work-related documents, bookmarks, and people in suggested results—clicking on these suggestions takes users to work or school results on M365.cloud.microsoft. Users can also type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then input their work- or school-related query to get results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page. Work and school search results will include documents, people, and bookmarks. Work search for documents will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.\n</li><li>The Windows search box will no longer display organization branding nor the “Work” or “School” tab but will continue to support work and school search. Search for documents and people remains available. will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible. With these changes, users will see some UX changes in the Windows search box.\n</li></ul></li></ul><p>As before, the core Microsoft Search experience remains accessible through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online.\n</p><ul><li>Additionally, Entra ID sign-in will no longer be available on Bing.com, since work and school search is no longer available on Bing.com.\n</li></ul><p>An FAQ and further details are now available at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ\" target=\"_blank\">Guidance for retiring Microsoft Search in Bing for your organization</a>, which will be updated regularly.\n</p><p>[When will this happen:]</p><p>The last day of availability of Microsoft Search in Bing is March 31, 2025.\n</p><p>[How this affects your organization:]</p><p>For organizations using Microsoft Search in Bing, users will need to transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. \n</p><p>Users who are accustomed to using the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box can continue to conduct work searches through these endpoints entry points, with the expectation that there will be some adjustment in these experiences after the deprecation date. (For details on changes, please refer to the FAQ: https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ.)\n</p><p>Users who click on suggestions in the Edge for Business address bar or Windows search box may be redirected to Microsoft365.com before March 31, 2025. Also, as we begin testing the retirement experience, a small set of users may find before March 31 that Bing is intermittently unavailable as an entry point for work search. We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. Adding M365.cloud.microsoft to their favorites or to the favorites bar in Edge for Business may be a helpful alternative pathway. \n</p><p>[What you can do to prepare:]</p><p>Customers should prepare to stop using Microsoft Search in Bing by March 31, 2025, and transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. We recommend that you inform users about the upcoming change and the alternatives available. \n</p><p>Adding your preferred entry point from this set to favorites or favorites bar in Edge may be a helpful alternative pathway. Admins can easily set favorites in Edge for their organization, please see details here. \n</p><p>Additionally, users can continue to use the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box, with some changes expected. Please educate users that they should now type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then type in their work-related query to get work results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page.\n</p><p>If your organization is using the <code>AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled</code> policy today, you should update to the <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code> policy, if the policy is still needed.   \n</p><p>The new policy, <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code>, will be available starting in early March, with Edge for Business version 134 (ahead of the Microsoft Search in Bing deprecation). This allows admins to configure the display of work suggestions in the address bar. If the policy is enabled or not configured, users who are signed into Edge for Business with their Entra ID can view internal work-related suggestions, such as bookmarks, files, and people results powered by Microsoft 365, in the Edge for Business address bar suggestion dropdown. If the policy is disabled, Entra ID signed-in users will not see internal workplace results in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion dropdown. \n</p><p>Admins who wish to set their own deprecation date prior to March 31, 2025, can turn off Microsoft Search in Bing by going to the Microsoft 365 admin center &gt; Settings &gt; Search &amp; Intelligence.\n</p><p>Regarding SafeSearch settings: \n</p><ul><li>If you had set the search experience for your organization to “School search,” SafeSearch was set to Strict by default. If you’d like to ensure that your users continue to have SafeSearch set to Strict after the Microsoft Search in Bing retirement, you can map www.bing.com to strict.bing.com at a network level.

This change is being made as we streamline search experiences and focus on enhancing core productivity tools.\n</p><p>The Microsoft Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box will continue to support work and school search, with some adjustments detailed below. \n</p><p>Details of the Change\n</p><p>After March 31, 2025, Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer be available, with changes as follows:\n</p><ul><li>Bing.com will no longer show work or school search results. Consequently, there will not be a dedicated page of work or school results and users’ work or school profiles will no longer appear on Bing.com. However, selecting the Work or School tab on Bing.com will redirect users to the new Microsoft Search experience on M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com).\n</li><li>Search boxes you’ve configured to point to Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer provide work or school results.\n</li><li>The Edge for Business address bar and Windows search box will continue to support work and school search with some adjustments, including:\n<ul><li>The Edge for Business address bar will no longer return work or school search results on a Bing.com page but will continue to provide suggested results in the address bar. In addition, the address bar will send users to work and school results on M365.cloud.microsoft rather than Bing.com. Users of the address bar can continue to find work-related documents, bookmarks, and people in suggested results—clicking on these suggestions takes users to work or school results on M365.cloud.microsoft. Users can also type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then input their work- or school-related query to get results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page. Work and school search results will include documents, people, and bookmarks. Work search for documents will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.\n</li><li>The Windows search box will no longer display organization branding nor the “Work” or “School” tab but will continue to support work and school search. Search for documents and people remains available. will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible. With these changes, users will see some UX changes in the Windows search box.\n</li></ul></li></ul><p>As before, the core Microsoft Search experience remains accessible through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online.\n</p><ul><li>Additionally, Entra ID sign-in will no longer be available on Bing.com, since work and school search is no longer available on Bing.com.\n</li></ul><p>An FAQ and further details are now available at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ\" target=\"_blank\">Guidance for retiring Microsoft Search in Bing for your organization</a>, which will be updated regularly.\n</p><p>[When will this happen:]</p><p>The last day of availability of Microsoft Search in Bing is March 31, 2025.\n</p><p>[How this affects your organization:]</p><p>For organizations using Microsoft Search in Bing, users will need to transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. \n</p><p>Users who are accustomed to using the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box can continue to conduct work searches through these endpoints entry points, with the expectation that there will be some adjustment in these experiences after the deprecation date. (For details on changes, please refer to the FAQ: https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ.)\n</p><p>Users who click on suggestions in the Edge for Business address bar or Windows search box may be redirected to Microsoft365.com before March 31, 2025. Also, as we begin testing the retirement experience, a small set of users may find before March 31 that Bing is intermittently unavailable as an entry point for work search. We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. Adding M365.cloud.microsoft to their favorites or to the favorites bar in Edge for Business may be a helpful alternative pathway. \n</p><p>[What you can do to prepare:]</p><p>Customers should prepare to stop using Microsoft Search in Bing by March 31, 2025, and transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. We recommend that you inform users about the upcoming change and the alternatives available. \n</p><p>Adding your preferred entry point from this set to favorites or favorites bar in Edge may be a helpful alternative pathway. Admins can easily set favorites in Edge for their organization, please see details here. \n</p><p>Additionally, users can continue to use the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box, with some changes expected. Please educate users that they should now type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then type in their work-related query to get work results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page.\n</p><p>If your organization is using the <code>AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled</code> policy today, you should update to the <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code> policy, if the policy is still needed.   \n</p><p>The new policy, <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code>, will be available starting in early March, with Edge for Business version 134 (ahead of the Microsoft Search in Bing deprecation). This allows admins to configure the display of work suggestions in the address bar. If the policy is enabled or not configured, users who are signed into Edge for Business with their Entra ID can view internal work-related suggestions, such as bookmarks, files, and people results powered by Microsoft 365, in the Edge for Business address bar suggestion dropdown. If the policy is disabled, Entra ID signed-in users will not see internal workplace results in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion dropdown. \n</p><p>Admins who wish to set their own deprecation date prior to March 31, 2025, can turn off Microsoft Search in Bing by going to the Microsoft 365 admin center &gt; Settings &gt; Search &amp; Intelligence.\n</p><p>Regarding SafeSearch settings: \n</p><ul><li>If you had set the search experience for your organization to “School search,” SafeSearch was set to Strict by default. If you’d like to ensure that your users continue to have SafeSearch set to Strict after the Microsoft Search in Bing retirement, you can map www.bing.com to strict.bing.com at a network level.

Details are not yet determined, but they will be added to the FAQ once they're finalized.&nbsp;</p>",

The future goal is to have a consistent button reporting experience across all Outlook platforms. If you are using Microsoft reporting add-ins in Outlook for iOS/Android, your users will see two reporting experiences: one from the built-in Outlook buttons (added by this rollout) and one from the add-in. Both options will behave the same for users (except for the newly customizable pop-ups) and the reported messages will end up in the same place, causing minimal disruption.\n</li><li>The selections you make on the user reported settings page will determine the reporting experience for your users (whether they choose the add-in or built-in reporting option in Outlook). Either option will report to the same place (Microsoft, custom mailbox, or both) based on your <i>User reported</i> settings.\n</li><li>Like OWA and new Outlook for Windows, the built-in reporting button in Outlook for iOS/Android supports reporting from shared and delegate mailboxes.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/22eb1216-2719-44ca-8ab5-e611d7cde37f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/ebc62ca7-713b-4938-ae0e-dca993cb2e0f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p>This change is available by default.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

        "Description": "<p>Updated February 19, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Outlook for iOS/Android: New built-in report buttons in version &gt; 4.2446 or later (android) and version &gt; 4.2508 or later (iOS). Admins can control the appearance and behavior of these buttons that allow users to report emails as phishing / junk / not junk from the User Reported setting page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (security.microsoft.com). Admins can also customize where messages get reported to (reporting mailbox, Microsoft, or both) and what the user sees both before and after reporting messages from these buttons.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=371383\" target=\"_blank\">371383</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High): We began rolling out in early December 2024 and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). </p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>Information to keep in mind:\n</p><ul><li>Microsoft OWA (Outlook on the Web) and the new Microsoft Outlook for Windows have had this functionality since November 2022. This rollout to iOS/Android does not change or affect that functionality.\n</li><li>Classic Microsoft Outlook for Windows client has had this functionality in current channel since August 2024. Learn more: MC841229<i> (Updated) Classic Microsoft Outlook for Windows: New reporting buttons integrated with Microsoft Defender for Office 365</i> (published July 2024, updated October 2024).\n</li><li>Microsoft Outlook for Mac released this functionality in September 2024.\n</li><li>If you have turned off the reporting feature in the Microsoft 365 Defender <i>User reported </i>settings page or are using a third-party add-in, the report buttons in Outlook for Android/iOS won't be visible.\n</li><li>The Microsoft reporting add-in (the Microsoft report message add-in and Microsoft phishing add-in) will be supported till further notice. The future goal is to have a consistent button reporting experience across all Outlook platforms. If you are using Microsoft reporting add-ins in Outlook for iOS/Android, your users will see two reporting experiences: one from the built-in Outlook buttons (added by this rollout) and one from the add-in. Both options will behave the same for users (except for the newly customizable pop-ups) and the reported messages will end up in the same place, causing minimal disruption.\n</li><li>The selections you make on the user reported settings page will determine the reporting experience for your users (whether they choose the add-in or built-in reporting option in Outlook). Either option will report to the same place (Microsoft, custom mailbox, or both) based on your <i>User reported</i> settings.\n</li><li>Like OWA and new Outlook for Windows, the built-in reporting button in Outlook for iOS/Android supports reporting from shared and delegate mailboxes.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/22eb1216-2719-44ca-8ab5-e611d7cde37f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/ebc62ca7-713b-4938-ae0e-dca993cb2e0f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p>This change is available by default.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

        "Description": "<p>We are excited to announce the Public Preview of the new version of Message trace in the Microsoft Exchange admin center (EAC) in Microsoft Exchange Online. Admins will soon be able to access the new Message trace and its capabilities by default in the Exchange admin center &gt; <i>Mail flow &gt; Message trace.</i> Also, admins will be able to use the new Message trace functionality using Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet <code>Get-MessageTraceV2</code> (similar to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-messagetrace?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Get-MessageTrace (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a>).\n</p><p>The new Message trace will be toggled <i>On</i> by default after being deployed to your tenant. If you wish to disable the preview, you can change the toggle to <i>Off</i> in the Message trace flyout.

This update is still in progress and will be made available in early-February.\n</li><li>Wider flyout option: An option for a wider flyout for the Message trace detail will be available.\n</li><li>Time zone consistency: Message trace will default to the time zone set in the Exchange account settings of the logged-on admin.\n</li></ul><p><b>Key cmdlet changes in </b><code>Get-MessageTraceV2</code> (relative to <code>Get-MessageTrace</code>)\n</p><ul><li>Extended query range: You can query up to 90 days of historical data.

Agents utilizing metered consumption are off by default. To enable, admins will need to set up or utilize an existing Azure subscription for Copilot Studio. More details on how to manage metered consumption will be available in mid-January.\n</p><p>No action is needed to enable agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot-licensed users – the use of agents comes with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses.\n</p><p>For the name and icon changes, no action is required.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>Updated January 15, 2025:  With the Email OTP verification meeting option rollout to Targeted Release for end users, Admins should note that the new meeting policy called Anonymous users can join a meeting after verifying will be available in Teams Admin Center for all organizations, even those in General Availability.  For tenants where the Anonymous users can join meetings option is disabled in meeting policy and admins would like to continue to block all unverified (anonymous) users joining meetings, admins should update the new meeting policy setting Anonymous users can join a meeting after verifying from “By e-mail code” to “No” by mid-February.  Without changing the default, this new feature introduces an additional way for unverified (anonymous) users to join meetings by e-mail code without needing an MSA or Entra account. Admins can reference documentation on managing the new meeting policy setting here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/anonymous-users-in-meetings\" target=\"_blank\">Manage anonymous participant access to Teams meetings, webinars, and town halls (IT admins) - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p>The experience for attendees to verify their email with OTP prior to joining meetings is available only for meetings created by organizers that have a Teams premium license. However, the new meeting option to require verification will be available to all meeting organizers without Teams Premium license as well, for these meetings,  attendees can join meeting after verifying with their TFL account or Entra account.</p><p>After this rollout, Microsoft Teams meeting organizers will have a new meeting option to enable and require unverified (aka anonymous) participants joining meetings to verify their email addresses with a one-time password (OTP) verification code before joining the meeting. Tenant admins will have a new meeting policy to manage and control this setting in the Teams admin center.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of Microsoft 365 Copilot for Security in Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Policy Insights helps admins understand DLP policies and its constructs. This enhancement enables DLP admins to gain insights on coverage of policies on pivots like&nbsp;location, classifiers, and notifications.</p><p>DLP admins can get these insights on all the policies or on a few selected policies. They will be able to use prompts to gain a deeper level view of how a policy is configured for their digital landscape. This helps them align their data posture on a regular basis and make corrections to policy posture as needed.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=466740\" target=\"_blank\">466740</a>.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>Public Preview: We will began rolling out mid-November 2024 and expect to complete by early December 2024.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early February 2025 (previously early January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). </p><p>Currently, Copilot for Security is not designed for use by customers using US government clouds, including but not limited to GCC, GCC High, DoD, and Microsoft Azure Government. For more information, consult with your Microsoft representative.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Administrators can invoke the policy insights to understand the insights from all their policies or selected polices.

We saw improved deliverability, completion rates, and satisfaction when leveraging the channel in both countries. The channel was temporarily disabled in India in early 2024.

We will provide a subsequent update by the end of May 2025 (previously end of March) with an updated timeline for tenants that are opted out.</p><p>Starting April 15, 2025 (previously February 3), we're going to start gradually dropping messages that have multiple From addresses (also known as P2 From headers) without a Sender header from being processed via Exchange Online.\n</p><p>If we see significant traffic exhibiting multiple From addresses (P2 From headers) without a Sender header in your tenant in the month of September, we will send you a Message Center Post by October 15th alerting you and providing some sample message IDs.</p><p>We are doing this to comply with <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 5322 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2)</a>&nbsp;which mandates the Sender header to be present and contain a single address if the From header has more than one address. Noncompliance with this could be exploited by attackers, allowing them to impersonate a sender address by misleading the client into using the From header to determine the sender instead of the Sender header.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>April 15, 2025 (previously February 3)</p><p>We are delaying the rollout start date from December to April 15, 2025 (previously February 3) in order to provide more time to customers for investigating messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address.\n</p><p>Most of the traffic exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address will be inbound spam destined for your tenant sent by malicious spammers on the internet.\n</p><p>Some customers are sending legitimate emails with this malformed header configuration. On October 15, we sent a targeted MC post to customers showing high volumes of messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address as they may be impacted by this change.\n</p><p>For investigating if you will be impacted by this change, focus your investigation on messages sent using On Premises Inbound Connectors to Exchange Online. Authenticated mail submission is not impacted because submitting messages like this using those submissions are not allowed (Graph, Outlook clients, SMTP AUTH Client Submission).</p><p>[How this affects your organization:]\n</p><p>If email clients including devices and applications that you use to send messages, do so using multiple From addresses but without a Sender address header after April 15 2025 (previously December 1st), you will get an NDR error code 550 5.1.20 “Multiple From addresses are not allowed without Sender address’”.</p><p>[What you can do to prepare:]\n</p><p>When this change is in effect, if you need to send a message that has more than one email address in the From field, make sure that you have a single email address in the Sender header.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback.\n</p>",

We will provide a subsequent update by the end of May 2025 (previously end of March) with an updated timeline for tenants that are opted out.</p><p>Starting April 15, 2025 (previously February 3), we're going to start gradually dropping messages that have multiple From addresses (also known as P2 From headers) without a Sender header from being processed via Exchange Online.\n</p><p>If we see significant traffic exhibiting multiple From addresses (P2 From headers) without a Sender header in your tenant in the month of September, we will send you a Message Center Post by October 15th alerting you and providing some sample message IDs.</p><p>We are doing this to comply with <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 5322 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2)</a>&nbsp;which mandates the Sender header to be present and contain a single address if the From header has more than one address. Noncompliance with this could be exploited by attackers, allowing them to impersonate a sender address by misleading the client into using the From header to determine the sender instead of the Sender header.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>April 15, 2025 (previously February 3)</p><p>We are delaying the rollout start date from December to April 15, 2025 (previously February 3) in order to provide more time to customers for investigating messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address.\n</p><p>Most of the traffic exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address will be inbound spam destined for your tenant sent by malicious spammers on the internet.\n</p><p>Some customers are sending legitimate emails with this malformed header configuration. On October 15, we sent a targeted MC post to customers showing high volumes of messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address as they may be impacted by this change.\n</p><p>For investigating if you will be impacted by this change, focus your investigation on messages sent using On Premises Inbound Connectors to Exchange Online. Authenticated mail submission is not impacted because submitting messages like this using those submissions are not allowed (Graph, Outlook clients, SMTP AUTH Client Submission).</p><p>[How this affects your organization:]\n</p><p>If email clients including devices and applications that you use to send messages, do so using multiple From addresses but without a Sender address header after April 15 2025 (previously December 1st), you will get an NDR error code 550 5.1.20 “Multiple From addresses are not allowed without Sender address’”.</p><p>[What you can do to prepare:]\n</p><p>When this change is in effect, if you need to send a message that has more than one email address in the From field, make sure that you have a single email address in the Sender header.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback.\n</p>",

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>In 2023, we introduced Microsoft Teams apps that are compatible with Microsoft Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App (manifest version v1.13 or higher). Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in two major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late-January 2025 (previously mid-December 2024) and expect to complete late March 2025 (previously mid-January 2025). This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in March 2025. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. [For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)].</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",

Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late-January 2025 (previously mid-December 2024) and expect to complete late March 2025 (previously mid-January 2025). This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in March 2025. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. [For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)].</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",

After this rollout, you can install Teams apps for selected sets of users, groups, or all users in the organization, and <i style=\"\">Installed apps</i> in app setup policies will no longer be available.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=394274\" target=\"_blank\">394274</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>App centric management will roll out in four General Availability phases.\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out&nbsp;late July&nbsp;2024 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete late March 2025 (previously early February) phase applies to tenants who meet both conditions: 1) tenants with no <i>Installed apps</i> in the Global app setup policy and 2) tenants with no custom app setup policies created in the Teams admin center. After rollout, these tenants will have app centric management enabled for their app installs. Admins may see the <i>Manage apps</i> page in read-only mode for a short time.\n</li><li>Phase 2 | More details coming soon as a follow up MC post. This phase applies to tenants who meet both conditions: 1) tenants with apps added to <i>Installed apps</i> in the Global app setup policy and 2) tenants with no custom app setup policies created in the Teams admin center. This phase will migrate apps installed in the Global app setup policy to app centric management.\n</li><li>Phase 3 | More details coming soon as a follow up MC post. This phase applies to tenants with both the Global app setup policy and custom app setup policies. This phase will migrate apps installed for users and groups through <i>Installed apps</i> in app setup policies to app centric management.\n</li><li>Phase 4 | More details coming soon as a follow up MC post. This phase applies to all remaining tenants.\n</li></ul><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Before the rollout: If you install an app to a user, the user cannot actually use an admin preinstalled app if you did not take the additional step to allow the user to use it. After the rollout, if you install an app through app centric management, the user will immediately be able to use the app.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Before the roll out, a user will only have apps installed from a single app setup policy, following the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/assign-policies-users-and-groups#precedence-rules\" target=\"_blank\">policy resolution precedence rules</a>. After the rollout, if you have multiple custom app setup policies assigned to users or groups, apps from every policy will be installed to&nbsp;the user or group assigned to&nbsp;that policy, regardless of the policy resolution precedence rules.\n</p><p>&nbsp;[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>No action needed for Phase 1 tenants. We will update this message with more information before the rollouts for Phases 2-4 tenants.\n</p><p>You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",

Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy.

Rollout for scheduled meetings and channel Meet Now will be started in early July 2025 and expected to be completed by mid-July 2025. </p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early August 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously late June).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 (previously mid-April) and expect to complete by late May 2025 (previously late April). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase. Rollout for scheduled meetings and channel Meet Now will be started in early July 2025 and expected to be completed by mid-July 2025. </p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early August 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously late June).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

For additional information, please go to: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/retirement-of-rbac-application-impersonation-in-exchange-online/4062671\" target=\"_blank\">https://aka.ms/applicationimpersonationdeprecation</a>&nbsp;</p><p>We are announcing the retirement of the ApplicationImpersonation Role Based Access Control (RBAC) role in Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>We will begin the retirement in September 2024 (previously May) and in February 2025 will remove this role and its feature set from Exchange Online.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>You are receiving this message because this RBAC role is commonly used with Exchange Web Services (EWS) to enable one-to-many mailbox access. We are removing this feature and will begin blocking the assignment of the ApplicationImpersonation (RBAC) role to accounts.</p><p>This will require all apps to have an App Registration, use Application permissions (not Delegated), and use a secure credential for access. Despite this change, if your app is granted the <i>full_access_as_app</i> Application permission, it will provide the same level of mailbox access as the ApplicationImpersonation RBAC role.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>Review your current configuration and make changes as appropriate to minimize disruption to your service.</p><p>For more information, please see:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/ApplicationImpersonationDeprecation\" target=\"_blank\">Retirement of RBAC Application Impersonation in Exchange Online</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/impersonation-and-ews-in-exchange\" target=\"_blank\">Impersonation and EWS in Exchange</a></li></ul>",

The app status from the permission policy and tenant settings will be migrated to preserve the admin intent. The migration will not affect the end users and their ability to use the apps. Admins may see the Manage apps page in a read-only mode for a short time. \n</p><p style=\"\"><i>Phase 2</i> (from late May 2024 to mid-December 2024 (previously mid-November)) affects the tenants that use both global and custom app permission policies. This phase will let the admin choose to migrate to app centric management by following a migration process that will change the existing app permission policies to app assignments in the new app centric model. The admins will have the choice to modify the apps that are assigned using the custom permission policies to be accessible to groups, if they want.</p><p style=\"\"><i>Phase 3</i> (mid-April 2025) applies to the tenants that skipped the migration in phase 1 or 2. These tenants will be migrated automatically in this phase.

The first set of features that will be retired are:\n</p><ul><li>Record Center site template, used to create a new Record Center site.\n</li><li>Configure systems to   submit files to a site using the Record Center programmable interface   (commonly referred to as “send to” location).\n</li><li>Content Organizer\n</li></ul><p>For more information on the retirement plan that starts with removing support for new configurations of these features,    please see:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-microsoft-purview-risk-and-compliance-solutions\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Use Microsoft Purview risk and compliance solutions instead of the older information management and records management features in SharePoint for Microsoft 365</a></p><p>   \n</p><p>The retirement plan does not apply to features for SharePoint Server (On-Premises).\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]<br></p>\n\n<p>Retirement of these features will start to happen at the start of January 2025. \n</p><p>Additional reminders   will be shared leading up to this date.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]<br></p>\n\n<p>This retirement may impact your organization if you are using any of these features or feature behaviors. \n</p><p>Retirement of these Record Center features includes these outcomes:  \n</p><ul><li>Feature may no longer be supported by Microsoft support.\n</li><li>It may no longer be visible in the user interface.\n</li><li>Configurations may not be available through the user interface or programmatically, including enable and disable actions.</li></ul>\n<p>[What you need to do to prepare:]<br></p>\n<p>Microsoft won't automatically migrate your older information management and SharePoint records management features in SharePoint Online. If you choose not to migrate to supported features, the older features may no longer be supported.</p><p>Between now and the full retirement date of the feature, you have the flexibility to migrate your scenarios on your own schedule. For more information on migration strategies and modern features to use instead, please see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/migration-strategies\" target=\"_blank\">Migration strategies for moving to Microsoft Purview risk and compliance solutions from older information</a> management and records management for SharePoint.</p><p> \n</p><p>We recommend communicating this change to the team responsible for Data Lifecycle and Records Management and SharePoint records management at your organization.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks).

        "Description": "<p>Updated April 11, 2024: We have updated the content to reflect the change to Viva Engage. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks).
