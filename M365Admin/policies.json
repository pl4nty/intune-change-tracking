This policy applies to all Copilot products in the Microsoft Edge sidepane - namely, Microsoft 365 Copilot Business Chat and Microsoft Copilot with enterprise data protection (EDP).\n\nIf you enable this policy, Copilot will be able to access Microsoft Edge page content when users ask a contextual query to Copilot in the Microsoft Edge sidepane.\n\nIf you disable this policy, Copilot will not be able to access Microsoft Edge page content.\n\nIf you don't configure this policy, the default behavior is as follows:\n\n  - For non-EU countries, access is enabled by default.\n\n  - For EU countries, access is disabled by default.\n\n  - In both cases, if the policy is not configured, users can enable or disable Copilot access to Microsoft Edge page content using the toggle in Microsoft Edge settings.\n\nExceptions to the preceding behavior include when a page is protected using data loss prevention (DLP) measures. In that case, Copilot will not be able to access Microsoft Edge page content even when this policy is enabled.

HTTPS clients must verify that server certificates match the\nconnection's TLS parameters.\n\nStarting in Microsoft Edge 124, this\ncheck is always enabled.\n\nMicrosoft Edge 123 and earlier have the\nfollowing behavior:\n\nIf this policy is set to enabled,\nMicrosoft Edge will perform this key\ncheck. This helps prevent attacks where an attacker manipulates the browser into\ninterpreting a key in ways that the certificate owner did not intend.\n\nIf this policy is set to disabled,\nMicrosoft Edge will skip this key check in\nHTTPS connections that negotiate TLS 1.2 and use an RSA certificate that\nchains to a local trust anchor. Examples of local trust anchors include\npolicy-provided or user-installed root certificates. In all other cases, the\ncheck is performed independent of this policy's setting.\n\nIf this policy is not configured,\nMicrosoft Edge will behave as if the\npolicy is enabled.\n\nThis policy is available for administrators to preview the behavior of a\nfuture release, which will enable this check by default. At that point, this\npolicy will remain temporarily available for administrators that need more\ntime to update their certificates to meet the new RSA key usage requirements.\n\nConnections that fail this check will fail with the error\nERR_SSL_KEY_USAGE_INCOMPATIBLE. Sites that fail with this error likely have a\nmisconfigured certificate. Modern ECDHE_RSA cipher suites use the\n\"digitalSignature\" key usage option, while legacy RSA decryption cipher suites\nuse the \"keyEncipherment\" key usage option. If uncertain, administrators should\ninclude both in RSA certificates meant for HTTPS.",

This behavior can only be enabled if run_on_os_login is set to run_windowed.\n  If the app is already running, this setting will only take effect after the app is restarted.\n  If this field isn't defined, users can close the app.\n  (This is currently not supported in Microsoft Edge.)\n- (Since version 118) The force_unregister_os_integration field specifies if all OS integration for a web app, that is, shortcuts, file handlers, protocol handlers and so on will be removed or not.\n  If an app is already running, this property will come into effect after the app restarts.\n  This should be used with caution, since it can override any OS integration that is set automatically during the startup of the web applications system.

A tag corresponding to an 'enable' pattern will be included in the analysis request if the page URL matches a pattern associated to that tag as long as no 'disable' pattern with that same tag matches the page URL. The analysis occurs if at least 1 tag is to be included in the request.\n\n      The service_provider field identifies which analysis service provider the settings correspond to.\n\n      The block_until_verdict field being set to 1 means Chrome will wait to get a response from the analysis service before giving the page access to the data. Any other integer value means Chrome gives the page access to the data immediately.\n\n      The default_action field being set to block means Chrome will not give the page access to the data if an error occurs while communicating with the analysis service. Any other value means Chrome gives the page access to the data.\n\n      The minimum_data_size field indicates the minimum size (in bytes) data entered in Chrome must equal or surpass to be scanned. The default value is 100 bytes if the field is unset.\n\n      The require_justification_tags field is used to determine for which tags the connector should require the user to enter a justification to bypass a scan that results in a bypassable warning. If the field is not set, it's assumed that a justification is not required.\n\n      The custom_messages, message, learn_more_url, language and tag fields are used to configure a message to show the user when a warning is shown after a scan had a non-clean verdict. The message field contains the text to show the user and should have at most 200 characters. The learn_more_url field contains an admin-provided URL that will be clickable by the user to get more customer-provided information about why the action was blocked. The language field is optional and contains the language of the message. An empty language field or a value of 'default' indicates a message to be used when the user's language doesn't have a message. The tag field specifies for which type of scans the message is displayed. The custom_messages list can have zero or more entries, where each entry is required to have non-empty message and tag fields.\n\n      This policy requires additional setup to take effect, please visit https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=chrome_enterprise_connector_policies_setting for more information.",

The learn_more_url field contains an admin-provided URL that will be clickable by the user to get more customer-provided information about why the action was blocked. The language field is optional and contains the language of the message. An empty language field or a value of 'default' indicates a message to be used when the user's language doesn't have a message. The tag field specifies for which type of scans the message is displayed. The custom_messages list can have zero or more entries, where each entry is required to have non-empty message and tag fields.\n\n      This policy requires additional setup to take effect, please visit https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=chrome_enterprise_connector_policies_setting for more information.",
