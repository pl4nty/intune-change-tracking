It also affects the startup page if that's set to open to the new tab page.\n\nThis policy doesn't determine which page opens on startup; that's controlled by the \"RestoreOnStartup\" policy. It also doesn't affect the home page if that's set to open to the new tab page.\n\nIf you don't configure this policy, the default new tab page is used.\n\nIf you configure this policy *and* the \"NewTabPageSetFeedType\" policy, this policy has precedence.\n\nIf a blank tab is preferred, \"about:blank\" is the correct URL to use, not \"about://blank\".\n\nThis policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, joined to Microsoft Azure Active Directory, or instances that enrolled for device management. On macOS, this policy is available only on instances that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.",
