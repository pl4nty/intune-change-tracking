    "description": "Allow Microsoft Edge to monitor user passwords.\r\n\r\nIf you enable this policy and a user consents to enabling the policy, the user will get alerted if any of their passwords stored in Microsoft Edge are found to be unsafe. Microsoft Edge will show an alert and this information will also be available in Settings > Passwords > Password Monitor.\r\n\r\nIf you disable this policy, users will not be asked for permission to enable this feature. Their passwords will not be scanned and they will not be alerted either.\r\n\r\nIf you enable or don't configure the policy, users can turn this feature on or off.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about how Microsoft Edge finds unsafe passwords see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2133833\r\n\r\nAdditional guidance:\r\n\r\nThis policy can be set as both Recommended as well as Mandatory, however with an important callout.\r\n\r\nMandatory enabled: Given that individual user consent is a pre-condition to enabling this feature for a given user, this policy does not have a Mandatory enabled setting. If the policy is set to Mandatory enabled, the UI in Settings will not change and the following error message will be displayed in edge://policy\r\n\r\nExample Error state message: \"This policy value is ignored because Password Monitor requires the consent of the individual user for it to be turned on. You can ask users in your Organization to go to Settings > Profile > Password and turn on the feature.\"\r\n\r\nRecommended enabled: If the policy is set to Recommended enabled, the UI in Settings will remain in 'Off' state, but a briefcase icon will be made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - \"Your organization recommends a specific value for this setting and you have chosen a different value\"\r\n\r\nMandatory and Recommended disabled: Both these states will work the normal way, with the usual captions being shown to users.",
