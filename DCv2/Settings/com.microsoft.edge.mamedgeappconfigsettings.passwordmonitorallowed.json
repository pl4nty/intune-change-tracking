Microsoft Edge will show an alert and this information will also be available in Settings > Passwords > Password Monitor.\n\nIf you disable this policy, users will not be asked for permission to enable this feature. Their passwords will not be scanned and they will not be alerted either.\n\nIf you don't configure the policy, users can turn this feature on or off.\n\nTo learn more about how Microsoft Edge finds unsafe passwords see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2133833\">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2133833</a>\n\nAdditional guidance:\n\nThis policy can be set as both Recommended as well as Mandatory, however with an important callout.\n\nMandatory enabled: If the policy is set to Mandatory enabled, the UI in Settings will be disabled but remain in 'On' state, and a briefcase icon will be made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - \"This setting is managed by your organization.\"\n\nRecommended enabled: If the policy is set to Recommended enabled, the UI in Settings will remain in 'Off' state, but a briefcase icon will be made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - \"Your organization recommends a specific value for this setting and you have chosen a different value\"\n\nMandatory and Recommended disabled: Both these states will work the normal way, with the usual captions being shown to users.",
