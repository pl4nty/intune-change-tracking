The security zone will run without the added layer of security that is provided by the Protection from Zone Elevation security feature. If you select Prompt in the drop-down box, a warning is issued to the user that potentially risky navigation is about to occur.\r\n\r\nIf you disable this policy setting, the possibly harmful navigations are prevented. The Internet Explorer security feature will be on in this zone as set by Protection from Zone Elevation feature control.\r\n\r\nIf you do not configure this policy setting, Web sites from less privileged zones can open new windows in, or navigate into, this zone.",
