    "description": "Allows or disallows the indexing of items. This switch is for the Windows Search Indexer, which controls whether it will index items that are encrypted, such as the Windows Information Protection (WIP) protected files.\r\n\r\nWhen the policy is not configured, WIP protected items are indexed and the metadata about them are stored in an unencrypted location. The metadata includes things like file path and date modified.\r\n\r\nWhen the policy is enabled, the WIP protected items are not indexed and do not show up in the results in Cortana or file explorer. There may also be a performance impact on photos and Groove apps if there are a lot of WIP protected media files on the device.",
