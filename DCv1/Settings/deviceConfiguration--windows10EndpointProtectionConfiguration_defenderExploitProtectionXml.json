    "description": "Enables the IT admin to push out a configuration representing the desired system and application mitigation options to all the devices in the organization. The configuration is represented by an XML. Exploit protection applies helps protect devices from malware that use exploits to spread and infect. You use the Windows Security app or PowerShell to create a set of mitigations (known as a configuration). You can then export this configuration as an XML file and share it with multiple machines on your network so they all have the same set of mitigation settings.\r\n\r\nYou can also convert and import an existing EMET configuration XML file into an exploit protection configuration XML.",
