Configuring a device with a setting that isn’t supported on that device’s build is the same as not configuring the setting.\r\n\r\nNot configured: Users are able to install apps as defined by other policy settings. (RS3+)\r\n\r\nRecommend store if available: When installing an app from the web that is available in the Microsoft Store, users will see a message recommending they download it from the store. (RS5+)\r\n\r\nWarn when installing outside store: When installing an app from outside the Microsoft Store, users will see a warning advising them that files downloaded outside the store may not be safe. (RS5+)\r\n\r\nApp store only: Only permit app installations from the Microsoft Store. (RS3+)",
