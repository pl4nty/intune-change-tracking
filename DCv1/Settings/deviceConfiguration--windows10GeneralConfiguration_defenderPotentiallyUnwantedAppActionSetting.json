    "description": "The potentially unwanted application (PUA) protection feature in Microsoft Defender Antivirus can identify and block PUAs from downloading and installing on endpoints in your network.\r\n\r\nThese applications are not considered viruses, malware, or other types of threats, but might perform actions on endpoints that adversely affect their performance or use. PUA can also refer to applications that are considered to have a poor reputation.\r\n\r\nTypical PUA behavior includes:\r\n\r\nVarious types of software bundling\r\nAd injection into web browsers\r\nDriver and registry optimizers that detect issues, request payment to fix the errors, but remain on the endpoint and make no changes or optimizations (also known as \"rogue antivirus\" programs)\r\nThese applications can increase the risk of your network being infected with malware, cause malware infections to be harder to identify, and can waste IT resources in cleaning up the applications.",
