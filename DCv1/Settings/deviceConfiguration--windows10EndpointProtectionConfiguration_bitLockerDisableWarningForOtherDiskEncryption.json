    "description": "If BitLocker is enabled on a system that has already been encrypted by a third-party encryption product, it may render the device unusable. Data loss may occur and you may need to reinstall Windows. It is highly suggested to never enable BitLocker on a device that has third-party encryption installed or enabled.\r\n\r\nAs part of the BitLocker setup wizard, users are informed and asked to confirm that no third-party encryption is in place.\r\n\r\nWhen this setting is set to Yes, this warning prompt will be suppressed. When set to not configured, the setting will return to default which is to warn users about third-party encryption.\r\n\r\nIf BitLocker silent enable features are required, the third-party encryption warning must be hidden as any required prompt breaks silent enablement workflows.",
