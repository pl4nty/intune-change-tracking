They are prompted for a password to log on.\r\n\r\nIf you disable this policy setting, users can always log on to Remote Desktop Services automatically by supplying their passwords in the Remote Desktop Connection client.\r\n\r\nIf you do not configure this policy setting, automatic logon is not specified at the Group Policy level.\r\n",
