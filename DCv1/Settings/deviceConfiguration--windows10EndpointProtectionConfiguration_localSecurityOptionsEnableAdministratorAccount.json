In this case, an alternative member of the Administrators group must reset the password on the Administrator account. For information about how to reset a password, see To reset a password. Disabling the Administrator account can become a maintenance issue under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nUnder Safe Mode boot, the disabled Administrator account will only be enabled if the machine is non-domain joined and there are no other local active administrator accounts. If the computer is domain joined the disabled administrator will not be enabled.",
