    "description": "Setting this No will disable the use of Credential Guard, which is the Windows default. Setting this to Yes with UEFI lock will enable Credential Guard and not allow it to be disabled remotely, as the UEFI persisted configuration must be manually cleared. Setting this to Yes without UEFI lock will enable Credential Guard and allow it to be turned off without physical access to the machine.\r\nCredential Guard uses Windows Hypervisor to provide protections, which requires Secure Boot and DMA protections to function, which require hardware support. This setting will only successfully enable if the hardware requirements are met.",
