If the encryption method and options match that of this policy, configuration should return success. If an in-place BitLocker configuration option does not match this policy, configuration will likely return an error.\r\n      To apply this policy to a disk already encrypted, decrypt the drive and re-apply the MDM policy.\r\n      You can view the encryption status of all managed devices in the <a href=\"#blade/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMonitorMenu/encryptionReport\" target=\"_blank\"> Encryption Report</a>\r\n      Windows default is to not require BitLocker drive encryption, however on Azure AD Join and Microsoft Account (MSA) registration/login automatic encryption may apply enabling BitLocker at XTS-AES 128-bit encryption. You can view the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/encrypt-devices#full-disk-vs-used-space-only-encryption\" target=\"_blank\"> Full disk vs Used Space guide </a> to determine how the drive will be encrypted.\r\n    ",
