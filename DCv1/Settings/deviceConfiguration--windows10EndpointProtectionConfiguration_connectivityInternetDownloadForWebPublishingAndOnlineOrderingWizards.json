By default, Windows displays providers downloaded from a Windows website in addition to providers specified in the registry.\r\n\r\nIf you enable this policy setting, Windows does not download providers, and only the service providers that are cached in the local registry are displayed.\r\n\r\nIf you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a list of providers are downloaded when the user uses the web publishing or online ordering wizards.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation for the web publishing and online ordering wizards for more information, including details on specifying service providers in the registry.",
