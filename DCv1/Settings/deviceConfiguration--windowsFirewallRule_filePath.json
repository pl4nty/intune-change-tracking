If you specify multiple conditions in a single rule, these will be treated as an AND operation. i.e program=svchost.exe AND service=mpssvc, etc.\r\n\r\nAll of the app related conditions in a single rule work to scope the traffic even further, so they must all correspond to the specific app/service.",
