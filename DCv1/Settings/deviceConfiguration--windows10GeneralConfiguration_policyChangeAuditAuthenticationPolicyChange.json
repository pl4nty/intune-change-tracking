    "description": "This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by changes to the authentication policy such as the following:     Creation of forest and domain trusts.     Modification of forest and domain trusts.     Removal of forest and domain trusts.     Changes to Kerberos policy under Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Kerberos Policy.     Granting of any of the following user rights to a user or group:         Access This Computer From the Network.         Allow Logon Locally.         Allow Logon Through Terminal Services.         Logon as a Batch Job.         Logon a Service.     Namespace collision. For example, when a new trust has the same name as an existing namespace name.  If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an attempt to change the authentication policy is made. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts. If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when the authentication policy is changed.  Note: The security audit event is logged when the group policy is applied. It does not occur at the time when the settings are modified.",
