    "description": "Among the commands that follow, you can choose settings for Secure Boot and Secure Boot with DMA. In most situations, we recommend that you choose Secure Boot. This option provides Secure Boot with as much protection as is supported by a given computer’s hardware. A computer with input/output memory management units (IOMMUs) will have Secure Boot with DMA protection. A computer without IOMMUs will simply have Secure Boot enabled.\r\nIn contrast, with Secure Boot with DMA, the setting will enable Secure Boot—and VBS itself—only on a computer that supports DMA, that is, a computer with IOMMUs. With this setting, any computer without IOMMUs will not have VBS or HVCI protection, although it can still have WDAC enabled.",
