If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.\r\n\r\nNot Configured: Application installation packages are not detected and prompted for elevation. Enterprises that are running standard user desktops and use delegated installation technologies such as Group Policy Software Installation or Systems Management Server (SMS) should disable this policy setting. In this case, installer detection is unnecessary.",
