    "description": "This security setting determines what additional permissions will be granted for anonymous connections to the computer.\r\n\r\nWindows allows anonymous users to perform certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares. This is convenient, for example, when an administrator wants to grant access to users in a trusted domain that does not maintain a reciprocal trust.\r\n\r\nThis security option allows additional restrictions to be placed on anonymous connections as follows:\r\n\r\nEnabled: Prevent enumeration of SAM accounts. This option replaces Everyone with Authenticated Users in the security permissions for resources. Not Configured: No additional restrictions. Rely on default permissions.\r\n",
