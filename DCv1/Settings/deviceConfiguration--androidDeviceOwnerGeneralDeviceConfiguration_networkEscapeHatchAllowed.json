    "description": "Whether the network escape hatch is enabled. If a network connection can't be made at boot time, the escape hatch prompts the user to temporarily connect to a network in order to refresh the device policy. After applying policy, the temporary network will be forgotten and the device will continue booting. This prevents being unable to connect to a network if there is no suitable network in the last policy and the device boots into an app in lock task mode, or the user is otherwise unable to reach device settings.",
