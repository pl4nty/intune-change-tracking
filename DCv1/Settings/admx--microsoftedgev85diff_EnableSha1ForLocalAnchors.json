    "description": "DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.\r\n\r\nWhen this setting is enabled, Microsoft Edge allows connections secured by SHA-1 signed certificates so long as the the certificate chains to a locally-installed root certificate and is otherwise valid.\r\n\r\nNote that this policy depends on the operating system (OS) certificate verification stack allowing SHA-1 signatures. If an OS update changes the OS handling of SHA-1 certificates, this policy might no longer have effect.  Further, this policy is intended as a temporary workaround to give enterprises more time to move away from SHA-1. This policy will be removed in Microsoft Edge 92 releasing in mid 2021.\r\n\r\nIf you don't set this policy or set it to false, or the SHA-1 certificate chains to a publicly trusted certificate root, then Microsoft Edge won't allow certificates signed by SHA-1.\r\n\r\nThis policy is only available on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain or Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise instances enrolled for device management.",
