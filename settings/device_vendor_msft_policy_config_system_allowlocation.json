While the policy is set to 0 (Force Location Off) or 2 (Force Location On), any Location service call from an app would trigger the value set by this policy. When switching the policy back from 0 (Force Location Off) or 2 (Force Location On) to 1 (User Control), the app reverts to its original Location service setting. For example, an app's original Location setting is Off. The administrator then sets the AllowLocation policy to 2 (Force Location On. ) The Location service starts working for that app, overriding the original setting. Later, if the administrator switches the AllowLocation policy back to 1 (User Control), the app will revert to using its original setting of Off.",
