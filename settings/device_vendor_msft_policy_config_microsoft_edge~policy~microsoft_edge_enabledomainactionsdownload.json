    "description": "DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.\r\n\r\nAlthough this policy is used to enable/disable download of the domain actions list, it doesn't always achieve the desired state. The Experimentation and Configuration Service, which handles the download, has its own group policy to configure what is downloaded from the service. To avoid conflicting states, this policy is being deprecated and will be obsolete in milestone 85 onward. Please use the 'ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl' (Control communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service) policy instead.\r\n\r\nIn Microsoft Edge, Domain Actions represent a series of compatibility features that help the browser work correctly on the web.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft keeps a list of actions to take on certain domains for compatibility reasons. For example, the browser may override the User Agent string on a website if that website is broken due to the new User Agent string on Microsoft Edge. Each of these actions is intended to be temporary while Microsoft tries to resolve the issue with the site owner.\r\n\r\nWhen the browser starts up and then periodically afterwards, the browser will contact the Experimentation and Configuration Service that contains the most up to date list of compatibility actions to perform. This list is saved locally after it is first retrieved so that subsequent requests will only update the list if the server's copy has changed.\r\n\r\nIf you enable this policy, the list of Domain Actions will continue to be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.\r\n\r\nIf you disable this policy, the list of Domain Actions will no longer be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.\r\n\r\nIf you don't configure this policy, the list of Domain Actions will continue to be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.",
