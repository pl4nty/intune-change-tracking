In addition, if your file system is NTFS, users need to have Write access to Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Network\\Connections\\Pbk to delete a shared remote access connection.\r\n\r\nIf you disable this setting (and enable the \"Enable Network Connections settings for Administrators\" setting), users (including administrators) cannot delete all-user remote access connections. (By default, users can still delete their private connections, but you can change the default by using the \"Prohibit deletion of remote access connections\" setting.)\r\n\r\nImportant: If the \"Enable Network Connections settings for Administrators\" is disabled or not configured, this setting will not apply to administrators on post-Windows 2000 computers.\r\n\r\nIf you do not configure this setting, only Administrators and Network Configuration Operators can delete all user remote access connections.\r\n\r\nImportant: When enabled, the \"Prohibit deletion of remote access connections\" setting takes precedence over this setting. Users (including administrators) cannot delete any remote access connections, and this setting is ignored.\r\n\r\nNote: LAN connections are created and deleted automatically by the system when a LAN adapter is installed or removed. You cannot use the Network Connections folder to create or delete a LAN connection.\r\n\r\nNote: This setting does not prevent users from using other programs, such as Internet Explorer, to bypass this setting.\r\n ",
