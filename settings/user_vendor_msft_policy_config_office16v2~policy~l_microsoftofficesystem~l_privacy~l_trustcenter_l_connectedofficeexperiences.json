    "description": "\r\n        This policy setting allows you to control whether connected experiences are available to your users when they're using Office.\r\n\r\n        Connected experiences include experiences that analyze content, such as Editor in Word, experiences that download online content, such as PowerPoint QuickStarter, and other connected experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage. It also includes additional optional connected experiences, such as the LinkedIn features of the Resume Assistant in Word or the 3D Maps feature in Excel, which uses Bing. See the Note at the end for more information about other policy settings that you can use to control these connected experiences.\r\n\r\n        If you enable this policy setting, these connected experiences will be available to your users.\r\n\r\n        If you disable this policy setting, these connected experiences won't be available to your users.\r\n\r\n        Note: If you disable this policy setting, nearly all connected experiences will be turned off.  However, limited Office functionality will remain available, such as synching a mailbox in Outlook. Essential services, such as the licensing service that confirms that youâ€™re properly licensed to use Office, will also remain available.\r\n\r\n        If you don't configure this policy setting, these connected experiences will be available to your users.\r\n\r\n        Note: You can use these other policy settings if you want to disable just a certain group of connected experiences:\"Allow the use of connected experiences in Office that analyze content,\" \"Allow the use of connected experiences in Office that download online content,\" and \"Allow the use of additional optional connected experiences in Office.\"\r\n\r\n        For more information, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2085689\r\n      ",
